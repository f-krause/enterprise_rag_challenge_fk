## Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This  Report  contains  'forward-looking  statements'  within  the  meaning  of  the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act  of  1995  (set  forth  in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 'Securities Act'), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act')). In particular, statements pertaining to our trends, liquidity, capital resources, and the healthcare industry and the healthcare real estate markets and opportunity, among others, contain forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology including,  but  not  limited  to,  'believes,'  'expects,'  'may,'  'will,'  'should,'  'seeks,'  'approximately,'  'intends,'  'plans,'  'estimates'  or 'anticipates' or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases which are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions.

Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, and you should not rely on them as predictions of future events. Forwardlooking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods which may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. We do not guarantee that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements:

- ● defaults on or non-renewal of leases by tenants;
- ● our ability to collect rents;
- ● increases in interest rates and increased operating costs;
- ● difficulties  in  identifying  healthcare  facilities  to  acquire  (due  to  increased  cost  of  capital,  competition  or  otherwise)  and  completing  such acquisitions;
- ● the outcome of a tenant bankruptcy process, including, but not limited to, whether: (i) the tenant accepts or rejects its lease with us, (ii) if the tenant accepts our lease, it is able to continue making rental payments to us after the conclusion of the bankruptcy process, or (iii) if the tenant rejects our lease, whether we will be paid any or all amounts due to us out of the bankruptcy estate;
- ● macroeconomic  and  geopolitical  factors,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  inflationary  pressures,  interest  rate  volatility,  global  supply  chain disruptions and ongoing geopolitical conflicts and war;
- ● the effects of the ongoing coronavirus ('COVID-19') pandemic (including any related variants of the COVID-19 virus such as the Delta variant, Omicron variant, or others), which are highly uncertain, cannot be predicted and will depend upon future developments, including the  severity  of  COVID-19,  the  duration  of  the  outbreak  and  potential  resurgences,  plateaued  or  stagnant  vaccination  and  booster  rates, adequate testing and treatments and the prevalence of widespread immunity to COVID-19;
- ● our ability to satisfy the covenants in our existing and any future debt agreements;
- ● decreased rental rates or increased vacancy rates, including expected rent levels on acquired properties;
- ● adverse economic or real estate conditions or developments, either nationally or in the markets in which our facilities are located;
- ● our failure to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding obligations;
- ● our ability to satisfy our short and long-term liquidity requirements;
- ● our ability to deploy the debt and equity capital we raise;
- ● our ability to hedge our interest rate risk;

## Table of Contents

- ● our ability to raise additional equity and debt capital on terms that are attractive or at all;
- ● our ability to make distributions on shares of our common and preferred stock or to redeem our preferred stock;
- ● expectations regarding the timing and/or completion of any acquisition;
- ● expectations regarding the timing and/or completion of dispositions, and the expected use of proceeds therefrom;
- ● general volatility of the market price of our common and preferred stock;
- ● changes in our business or our investment or financing strategy;
- ● our dependence upon key personnel, whose continued service is not guaranteed;
- ● our ability to identify, hire and retain highly qualified personnel in the future;

- ● our expected capital and tenant improvement expenditures;
- ● changes in accounting policies generally accepted in the United States of America ('GAAP');
- ● lack of, or insufficient amounts of, insurance;
- ● other factors affecting the real estate industry generally;
- ● changes in the tax treatment of our distributions;
- ● our failure to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust ('REIT') for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
- ● our ability to qualify for the safe harbors from the '100% Prohibited Transactions Tax' under the REIT rules with respect to our property dispositions; and
- ● limitations  imposed  on  our  business  and  our  ability  to  satisfy  complex  rules  relating  to  REIT  qualification  for  U.S.  federal  income  tax purposes.

See  Item  1A.  Risk  Factors  in  this  Report  for  further  discussion  of  these  and  other  risks,  as  well  as  the  risks,  uncertainties  and  other  factors discussed in this Report and identified in other documents we may file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') from time to time. You should carefully consider these risks before making any investment decisions in our company. New risks and uncertainties may also emerge from time to time that could materially and adversely affect us. While forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, of new information, data or methods, future events or other changes after the date of this Report, except as required by applicable law. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements that are based on information currently available to us or the third parties making the forward-looking statements.

## ITEM 1.     BUSINESS

## Organization

Global Medical REIT Inc. (the 'Company,' 'us,' 'we,' or 'our') is a Maryland corporation and internally managed REIT that acquires healthcare facilities and leases those facilities to physician groups and regional and national healthcare systems. The Company's common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2016. We conduct our  business  through  an  umbrella  partnership  real  estate  investment  trust,  or  UPREIT,  structure  in  which  our  properties  are  owned  by  wholly  owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership, Global Medical REIT L.P. (the 'Operating Partnership'). Our wholly owned subsidiary, Global Medical REIT GP LLC, is the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership and, as of December 31, 2022, we owned 93.97% of the outstanding common operating partnership  units  ('OP  Units')  of  our  Operating  Partnership  with  an  aggregate  of  6.03%  of  the  Operating  Partnership  owned  by  holders  of  long-term incentive plan units ('LTIP Units') and third-party limited partners who contributed properties or services to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units.

## Business Overview and Strategy

Our business strategy is to invest in healthcare properties that provide an attractive rate of return relative to our cost of capital and are operated by profitable  physician  groups,  regional  or  national  healthcare  systems  or  combinations  thereof. We  believe  this  strategy  allows  us  to  attain  our  goals  of providing stockholders with (i) reliable dividends and (ii) stock price appreciation. To implement this strategy, we seek to invest:

- ● in medical office buildings and other de-centralized components of the healthcare delivery system because we believe that healthcare delivery trends in the U.S. are increasingly moving away from centralized hospital locations;
- ● in small to mid-sized healthcare facilities located in secondary markets and suburbs of primary markets and that provide services needed for an aging population such as cardiovascular treatment, rehabilitation, eye surgery, gastroenterology, oncology treatment and orthopedics. We believe these facilities and markets are typically overlooked by larger REITs and other healthcare investors but contain tenant credit profiles that are like those of larger, more expensive facilities in primary markets; and
- ● to  a  lesser  extent,  in  opportunistic  acquisitions,  including  (i)  certain  acute-care  hospitals  and  long-term  acute  care  facilities  (LTACs)  that  we believe provide premium, risk-adjusted returns, (ii) health system corporate office and administrative buildings, which we believe will help us develop relationships with larger health systems and (iii) behavioral and mental health facilities that are operated by national or regional operators and are located in markets that demonstrate a need for such services.

Most of our healthcare facilities are leased to single-tenants under triple-net leases. As we continue to grow our portfolio and the competition for single-tenant, triple-net leased properties has intensified, we have added to our portfolio some multi-tenant properties with gross lease or modified gross lease structures.

## Corporate Sustainability and Social Responsibility

Our business values integrate environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and strong governance practices throughout our Company.

Our Board of Directors (the 'Board') continues to lead our environmental, social and governance ('ESG') efforts and our Board has a standing ESG committee. The primary purpose of the ESG committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling our responsibilities to provide oversight and support of our commitment to ESG matters by overseeing: (1) our general ESG strategy and policies as set by our management, (2) communications with our employees, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to ESG matters, (3) developments relating to, and improving our understanding of, ESG matters, (4) our compliance with certain ESG-related legal and regulatory requirements, and (5) coordination with other Board committees on ESG matters of common import.

## PART I

## Table of Contents

We continue to improve and expand our efforts in the corporate sustainability arena through tenant outreach and data collection to benchmark our portfolio's energy consumption and efficiency. We submitted our 2022 GRESB assessment report on July 1, 2022 and received a score of 46, which was higher than our 2021 score.

Our commitment to employee engagement remains a high-priority, as we continue to make accommodations for health, safety, and work-life

## balance.

In 2022, we expanded our partnership with a national charitable organization to provide transportation in Orlando, Florida to healthcare facilities for those in need. We started the project in 2021 in the Phoenix, Arizona metro area with a ride-share provider and a national charitable organization. The program's success has allowed us to expand into Orlando, Florida and to potentially more cities in the future.

## Climate Change

We take climate change and the risks associated with climate change seriously. We prioritize energy efficiency and sustainability when evaluating investment opportunities and have begun to monitor our portfolio for climate risk factors. We utilize utility and energy audits that are performed by thirdparty  engineering  consultants  during  the  due  diligence  phase  of  our  acquisitions.  The  energy  consumption  data  that  we  collect  is  used  to  assess  our facilities' carbon emission levels. Capturing and tracking this information may help inform future mitigation and remediation efforts when possible. To that end, we are exploring ways to mitigate climate risk, should it be present, in our acquisition strategy, as well as ways to contribute to the reduction of climate impact through proactive asset management that looks for ways to incorporate renewable energy resources and energy utilization reduction. We stand  with  our  communities,  tenants,  and  stockholders  in  supporting  meaningful  solutions  that  address  this  global  challenge  and  contribute  to  the sustainability of our business objectives.

## Impact of Inflation

After  many  years  of  low  inflation,  the  U.S.  inflation  rate  increased  substantially  during  2022,  with  the  December  2022  annual  inflation  rate equaling 6.5%. In response to the increase in the inflation rate, the U.S. Federal Reserve (the 'Fed') instituted a number of increases to the Federal Funds Rate throughout the year, with the rate increasing from a target range of 0% to 0.25% at the beginning of 2022 to a current range of 4.50% to 4.75% as of its meeting in February 2023. The increase in the Federal Funds Rate, along with other actions taken by the Fed, had a ripple effect on other benchmark interest rates, including one-month term Standard Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR'), which is the reference rate for our indebtedness under our Second Amended  and  Restated  Credit  Facility  (the  'Credit  Facility').  From  the  beginning  of  2022  through  February  24,  2023,  one-month  term  SOFR  has increased from close to 0% to 4.5%, which, in turn, has led to a significant increase in our interest expense.

Additionally,  as  most  of  our  leases  are  triple-net  leases,  we  are  somewhat  insulated  from  the  effects  of  inflation  on  our  operating  expenses. However, due to the longer-term nature of our leases, we are not able to quickly increase rents to offset fully the effects of increased interest rates and inflation on our interest expense and other costs.

## Continuing Impact of COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the healthcare industry in many ways. Many stories exist about U.S. healthcare workers, especially nurses, experiencing burnout due to the length and severity of the pandemic, and this has caused many nurses and other medical professionals to switch jobs within the medical profession or quit the profession altogether. This phenomenon has led to material increases in labor costs for healthcare systems, especially hospital systems, as some employers have had to rely on higher costing contract nursing labor to sustain their businesses. The increase in labor costs, among various other factors, contributed to the rapid increase in inflation during 2022.

Furthermore, the continued spread of the BA.5 variant of COVID-19 (and its subvariants) in the U.S. has prolonged the COVID-19 pandemic, which could continue to disrupt our operations and the operations of our tenants and third-party service providers.

## Our Properties

As of December 31, 2022 we had gross investments of approximately $1.5 billion in real estate properties, consisting of 189 buildings with an aggregate of (i) approximately 4.9 million leasable square feet and (ii) approximately $114.5 million of annualized base rent. The tables below summarize information  about  our  portfolio  as  of  December  31,  2022.  Also  see  'Schedule  III  -  Consolidated  Real  Estate  and  Accumulated  Depreciation,'  for additional information about our properties.

## Geographic Concentration

The following table contains information regarding the geographic concentration of our portfolio as of December 31, 2022. Adverse economic or other conditions (including significant weather events) in the states that contain a high concentration of our facilities could adversely affect us. See 'Risk FactorsWe have significant geographic concentration in a small number of states, including Texas, Florida, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Illinois. Economic and other conditions that negatively affect those states and our tenants in those states could have a greater effect on our revenues than if our properties were more geographically diverse .'

## Significant Tenants

The following tenants each account for at least 5% of our annualized base rent as of December 31, 2022. Adverse changes to any of their financial conditions or our failure to renew our leases with these tenants could adversely affect us. See 'Risk FactorsThe inability of any of our significant tenants to pay rent to us could have a disproportionate negative affect on our revenues ' and ' Risk FactorsMost of our healthcare facilities are occupied by a single tenant, and we may have difficulty finding suitable replacement tenants in the event of a tenant default or non-renewal of our leases, especially for our healthcare facilities located in smaller markets.

## Ground Leases

As of December 31, 2022, we had seven buildings located on land that is subject to operating ground leases, representing approximately 3.8% of our total leasable square feet and approximately 4.2% of our December 2022 annualized base rent. The ground leases subject these properties to certain restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to re-let such facilities to tenants not affiliated with the ground lessor, rights of first offer and refusal with respect to sales of the facilities and restrictions that limit the types of medical procedures that may be performed at the facilities.

## Recent Developments

## Chapter 11 Reorganization Filing of Pipeline Health System, LLC

On October 3, 2022, Pipeline Health System, LLC ('Pipeline'), announced that it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code. At the time of its bankruptcy filing, Pipeline operated seven hospitals in three states, including the White Rock Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, an acute-care hospital owned by the Company where Pipeline is the sole tenant. According to the filed bankruptcy documents, although Pipeline has experienced the same labor and reimbursement pressures that many acute-care hospitals have been facing since the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic, the primary reason for the bankruptcy filing relates to Pipeline's facilities in Chicago, Illinois, and not the White Rock Medical Center. While in bankruptcy, Pipeline sold its facilities in Chicago, Illinois and on January 13, 2023, the bankruptcy court approved Pipeline's plan of reorganization (the 'Reorganization Plan'). As part of the Reorganization Plan, Pipeline agreed to assume our leases at White Rock Medical Center with certain amendments to  facilitate  its  emergence  from  bankruptcy  and  new  operating  plan. The  Reorganization  Plan  with  respect  to  the  Company's  leases  with  Pipeline  was effective as of February 6, 2023.

## Acquisition Under Contract

As of February 24, 2023, we had one acquisition under contract for a purchase price of approximately $6.7 million. We are currently in the due diligence period for our property under contract. If we identify problems with this property or the operator of this property during our due diligence review, we may not close the transaction on a timely basis or we may terminate the purchase agreement and not close the transaction.

## Properties Under Contract for Sale

As of February 24, 2023, we had two properties under contract for sale for aggregate gross sales proceeds of approximately $11.6 million and an aggregate net book value of $8.3 million. The transactions are expected to be completed by March 31, 2023. The buyers are currently in the due diligence periods and the transactions are subject to various closing contingencies. Accordingly, the transactions may not close on a timely basis or the buyers may terminate the purchase agreements and not close the transactions.

## Healthcare Industry and Healthcare Real Estate Market Opportunity

We believe our primary investment strategy takes advantage of current trends in healthcare and healthcare delivery, including an aging population and the decentralization of healthcare, while also providing flexibility to make opportunistic acquisitions and dispositions.

## Aging U.S. Population Driving Increase in Demand for Healthcare Services

The general aging of the population, driven by the baby boomer generation and advances in medical technology and services which increase life expectancy, is a key driver of the growth in healthcare expenditures. According to the 2020 U.S. Census, the nation's 65-and older population has grown rapidly since 2010, driven by Baby Boomers born between 1946 and 1964. The 65-and-older population grew by over a third during the past decade, and by 3.2% from 2018 to 2019. We believe that demographic trends in the United States, including an aging population, will result in continued growth in the demand for healthcare services utilized by an aging population, which in turn will lead to an increasing need for a greater supply of specialized, welllocated healthcare facilities.

## Clinical Care Continues to Shift Away from Large, Centralized Facilities

We believe the continued shift in the delivery of healthcare services away from large, centralized facilities to smaller, more specialized facilities will increase the need for smaller, more specialized and efficient hospitals and outpatient facilities that take advantage of these shifting trends. Procedures traditionally performed in large, general hospitals, such as certain types of surgeries, are increasingly moving to more conveniently located, specialized facilities driven by advances in clinical science, shifting consumer preferences, limited or inefficient space in existing hospitals and lower costs in the nonhospital environment.

## Table of Contents

## Opportunistic Acquisitions

Despite the continued shift in the delivery of healthcare services to smaller, more specialized facilities, we believe opportunities exist to acquire larger, acute-care facilities, such as acute-care hospitals and LTACs, with very attractive submarket fundamentals at compelling valuations. Despite the trends away from acute-care facilities, we believe that certain, well-located acute-care hospitals and LTACs will still be critical components of the U.S. healthcare system.

We also opportunistically invest in large health system's corporate and administrative office buildings. We believe investments in these types of facilities helps us build relationships with large health systems, which could lead to us becoming a preferred landlord for such health systems' medical facilities.

We also invest in behavioral and mental health facilities that are operated by national or regional operators and are in markets that demonstrate a need for such services.

Although not the primary focus of our investment strategy, we believe allocating a portion of our portfolio to opportunistic acquisitions helps diversify our portfolio and is consistent with our strategy of aligning ourselves with strong operators.

## Dispositions

We believe in certain circumstances, dispositions help to strengthen our portfolio and provide cash flow and gains from the sales that can be used for re-investment or to reduce indebtedness.

In July 2022, we sold a medical office building located in Germantown, Tennessee receiving gross proceeds of $17.9 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $6.8 million.

## Qualification as a REIT

We elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2016. Subject to a number of significant exceptions, a corporation  that  qualifies  as  a  REIT  generally  is  not  subject  to  U.S.  federal  corporate  income  taxes  on  income  and  gains  that  it  distributes  to  its stockholders, thereby reducing its corporate-level taxes. In order to qualify as a REIT, a substantial percentage of our assets must be qualifying real estate assets and a substantial percentage of our income must be rental revenue from real property or interest on mortgage loans. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner. However, we cannot provide assurances that we will continue to operate in a manner to remain qualified as a REIT.

## Competition

We  compete  with  many  other  real  estate  investors  for  acquisitions  of  healthcare  properties,  including  healthcare  operators,  and  real  estate investors such as private equity firms and other REITs, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. The resiliency of medical office buildings during the COVID-19 pandemic caused many real estate investors to enter the market in search of reliable returns. This influx of investors has caused medical office building prices and competition to increase significantly, especially for Class A properties in prime locations, but has also caused similar increases in our target markets.

Additionally,  our  healthcare  facilities  and  tenants  often  face  competition  from  nearby  hospitals,  other  medical  practices,  and  other  healthcare facilities,  including  urgent  care  and  other  primary  care  facilities,  that  provide  comparable  services.  If  our  tenants'  competitors  have  greater  geographic coverage, improved access and convenience to physicians and patients, provide or are perceived to provide higher quality services, recruit physicians to provide competing services at their facilities, expand or improve their services or obtain more favorable managed-care contracts, our tenants may not be able to successfully compete.

## Table of Contents

## Government Programs, Laws and Regulations

## Medicare and Medicaid Programs

Sources  of  revenue  for  our  tenants  typically  include  the  Medicare  and  Medicaid  programs.  Healthcare  providers  continue  to  face  increased government pressure to control or reduce healthcare costs and significant reductions in healthcare reimbursement, including reduced reimbursements and changes to payment methodologies under the Affordable Care Act. In some cases, private insurers rely on all or portions of the Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates, which may result in decreased reimbursement from private insurers.

The  need  to  control  Medicaid  expenditures  may  be  exacerbated  by  the  potential  for  increased  enrollment  in  Medicaid  programs  due  to unemployment and declines in family incomes. Historically, states have often attempted to reduce Medicaid spending by limiting benefits and tightening Medicaid eligibility requirements.

Efforts by Medicare and Medicaid to reduce reimbursements will likely continue, which could negatively affect our tenant's revenues and their ability to pay rent to us.

## Affordable Care Act

The Affordable Care Act is a comprehensive healthcare reform law that contains various provisions that may directly impact our tenants. The primary goal of the Affordable Care Act is to broaden insurance coverage for the uninsured population by expanding Medicaid coverage, creating health insurance  exchanges  and  mandating  that  uninsured  individuals  purchase  health  insurance.  The Affordable  Care Act  also  contains  provisions  aimed  at lowering the cost of healthcare, including lowering increases in Medicare payment rates and promoting alternate reimbursement methods for providers that focus on patient outcomes rather than volume. In addition to expanding coverage and controlling costs, the Affordable Care Act also contains provisions intended to combat healthcare fraud, including Medicare fraud and abuse. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court partially invalidated the expansion of Medicaid and allowed states not to participate in the expansion without losing their existing Medicaid funding. In addition, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA. The TCJA eliminated the tax penalty for violating the individual mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act.

Although the Affordable Care Act's expansion of insurance coverage may benefit our tenants by increasing their number of insured patients, these benefits may be offset by the fact that (i) many of the newly insured under the Affordable Care Act are insured by policies that have high deductibles (and, thus,  create  higher  patient  credit  risks  for  our  tenants),  (ii)  some  states  have  not  implemented  the  Medicaid  expansion  or  have  implemented  Medicaid expansion in such ways that may reduce potential enrollment (such as implementing work requirements), and, (iii) even if states have expanded Medicaid, Medicaid may not be accepted by some of our tenants. For our tenants that do accept Medicaid, they may receive lower reimbursements for Medicaid patients than for patients with Medicare or commercial insurance. Additionally, although the migration from Medicare fee-for-service, or volume-based, payments to an outcome-based reimbursement model may lower overall healthcare costs, these changes could negatively affect our tenants if they are unable to adapt to a more outcome-oriented healthcare delivery model.

The future of the Affordable Care Act is uncertain and any changes to existing laws and regulations, including the Affordable Care Act's repeal, modification or replacement, could have a long-term financial impact on the delivery of and payment for healthcare. Both our tenants and us may be adversely affected by the law or its repeal, modification or replacement.

## Fraud and Abuse Laws

There are various federal and state laws prohibiting fraudulent and abusive business practices by healthcare providers who participate in, receive payments  from,  or  are  able  to  make  referrals  in  connection  with,  government-sponsored  healthcare  programs,  including  the  Medicare  and  Medicaid programs. Our leases with certain tenants may also be subject to these fraud and abuse laws. These laws include, without limitation:

- ● The  Federal  Anti-Kickback  Statute,  which  prohibits,  among  other  things,  the  offer,  payment,  solicitation  or  receipt  of  any  form  of remuneration in return for, or to induce, the referral of any U.S. federal or state healthcare program patients;

## Table of Contents

- ● The  Federal  Physician  Self-Referral  Prohibition  (commonly  called  the  'Stark  Law'),  which,  subject  to  specific  exceptions,  restricts physicians  who  have  financial  relationships  with  healthcare  providers  from  making  referrals  for  designated  health  services  for  which payment may be made under Medicare or Medicaid programs to an entity with which the physician, or an immediate family member, has a financial relationship;
- ● The  False  Claims  Act,  which  prohibits  any  person  from  knowingly  presenting  false  or  fraudulent  claims  for  payment  to  the  federal government, including under the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
- ● The Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to impose monetary penalties for certain fraudulent acts; and
- ● State  anti-kickback,  anti-inducement,  anti-referral  and  insurance  fraud  laws  which  may  be  generally  similar  to,  and  potentially  more expansive than, the federal laws set forth above.

Violations  of  these  laws  may  result  in  criminal  and/or  civil  penalties  that  range  from  punitive  sanctions,  damage  assessments,  penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments and/or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, the Affordable Care Act clarifies that the submission of claims for items or services generated in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the False Claims Act. The federal government has taken the position, and some courts have held, that violations of other laws, such as the Stark Law, can also be a violation of the False Claims Act. Additionally, certain laws, such as the False Claims Act, allow for individuals to bring whistleblower actions on behalf of the government for violations thereof. Imposition of any of these penalties upon one of our tenants could jeopardize that tenant's ability to operate or to make rent payments to us. Further, we enter into leases and other financial relationships with healthcare delivery systems that are subject  to  or  impacted  by  these  laws.  We  also  have  investors  who  are  healthcare  providers  in  our  operating  partnership.  If  any  of  our  relationships, including those related to the other investors in our subsidiaries, are found not to comply with these laws, we and our physician investors may be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties.

## Other Regulations

The healthcare industry is heavily regulated by U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities. Our tenants generally will be subject to laws and  regulations  covering,  among  other  things,  licensure,  and  certification  for  participation  in  government  programs,  billing  for  services,  privacy  and security of health information, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which provides for the privacy and security of certain individually identifiable health information, and relationships with physicians and other referral sources. In addition, new laws and regulations, changes in existing laws and regulations or changes in the interpretation of such laws or regulations could negatively affect our financial condition and the financial condition of our tenants. These changes, in some cases, could apply retroactively. The enactment, timing or effect of legislative or regulatory changes cannot be predicted.

Many  states  regulate  the  construction  of  healthcare  facilities,  the  expansion  of  healthcare  facilities,  the  construction  or  expansion  of  certain services, including by way of example specific bed types and medical equipment, as well as certain capital expenditures through certificate of need, or CON, laws. Under such laws, the applicable state regulatory body must determine a need exists for a project before the project can be undertaken. If one of our tenants seeks to undertake a CON-regulated project but is not authorized by the applicable regulatory body to proceed with the project, the tenants would be prevented from operating in its intended manner.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect us directly and our tenants' ability to make rent payments to us.

## Environmental Regulations

Under various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, current and prior owners and tenants of real estate may be jointly and severally  liable  for  the  costs  of  investigating,  remediating,  and  monitoring  certain  hazardous  substances  or  other  regulated  materials  on  or  in  such healthcare facility. In addition to these costs, the past or present owner or tenant of a healthcare facility from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injury or property damage that results from such release, including for the unauthorized release of asbestos-containing materials and other hazardous substances into the air, as well as any damages to natural resources or the environment that arise from such releases. These environmental laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the current or prior owner or tenant knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such substances or materials. Moreover, the release of hazardous substances or materials, or the failure to properly remediate such substances or materials, may adversely affect the owner's or tenant's ability to lease, sell, develop or rent such healthcare facility or to borrow by using such healthcare facility as collateral.

Certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and tenants of real property with respect to the management of hazardous substances and other regulated materials. For example, environmental laws govern the management and removal of asbestos-containing materials and leadbased paint. Failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions.

## Human Capital Resources

Our success is dependent on the success of our employees. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 29 employees.

We support diversity, equality, and inclusion in our workforce.  As of December 31, 2022, 34% of our workforce were women and 31% of our workforce was ethnically diverse. We believe we offer a competitive pay and benefits package, with nearly all of our employees participating in our equity incentive plans. We also foster the development of our employees' expertise and skillsets, and encourage our employees to build new skill sets, such as in the ESG space.

## ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

The following summarizes the material risks of purchasing or owning our securities. Our business, financial condition and/or results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be materially adversely affected by the nature and impact of these risks. In such case, the market value of our securities could be detrimentally affected, and investors may lose part or all of the value of their investment. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in this Item 1A, 'Risk Factors' included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:

- ● We are dependent on our tenants for our revenues. Our tenants face a wide range of business risks, including economic, competitive, government reimbursement and regulatory risks, any of which could cause our tenants to be unable to pay rent to us.

## Table of Contents

- ● We finance a portion of our portfolio with unhedged floating-rate debt from our Credit Facility. The rapid increase in inflation during 2022 led to a rapid increase in market interest rates, which materially increased the interest rate on our floating rate debt. In addition to interest rate risk, we are subject to additional risks associated with our Credit Facility generally, including covenant restrictions.
- ● Our assets are concentrated in healthcare-related facilities, making us more economically vulnerable to specific industry-related risks than if our assets were diversified across different industries.
- ● The inability of any of our significant tenants to pay rent to us could have a disproportionate negative affect on our business.
- ● Competition for medical office buildings has increased significantly since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- ● Most of our healthcare facilities are occupied by a single tenant, and we may have difficulty finding suitable replacement tenants in the event of a tenant default or non-renewal of our leases, especially for our healthcare facilities located in smaller markets.
- ● Our tenants' businesses have in the past  and could again in the future be materially and adversely affected by the effects of the COVID-19 virus, including labor shortages that have resulted from nurses and other medical personnel switching jobs within the medical profession or quitting the medical profession altogether, and other viruses or pandemics could cause similar effects in the future.
- ● We have significant geographic concentration in a small number of states, including Texas, Florida, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Illinois. Economic and other conditions that negatively affect those states and our tenants in those states could have a greater effect on our revenues than if our properties were more geographically diverse.
- ● We rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs, and, if we encounter difficulty in obtaining such capital, we may not be able to make future acquisitions necessary to grow our business or meet maturing obligations.
- ● Subject to certain requirements under Maryland law and REIT requirements, the Board has sole discretion to determine if we will pay distributions and the amount and frequency of such distributions, and past distribution amounts may not be indicative of future distribution amounts.
- ● Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for distributions to our stockholders.

## Risks Related to our Business and Healthcare Facilities

We are dependent on our tenants for our revenues. Our tenants face a wide range of business risks, including economic, competitive, government reimbursement and regulatory risks, any of which could cause our tenants to be unable to pay rent to us.

We are dependent on our tenants for our revenues. Our tenants face a wide range of business risks, including economic, competitive, government reimbursement and regulatory risks, which may adversely affect their businesses and, in turn, their ability to pay rent to us. If any of our tenants were unable to pay their rent  to  us,  our  revenues  and  operating  cash  flows  could  be  materially  adversely  affected,  which  in  turn  could  affect  our  business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Table of Contents

## Our assets  are  concentrated  in  healthcare-related  facilities,  making  us  more  economically  vulnerable  to  specific  industry-related  risks  than  if  our assets were diversified across different industries.

We acquire and own healthcare-related facilities. We are subject to risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and specifically healthcare real estate. Any adverse effects that result from these risks could be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of the healthcare industry. Any healthcare industry downturn could adversely affect the ability of our tenants to pay us rents and our ability to maintain current rental and occupancy rates. Our tenant mix could become even more concentrated if a significant portion of our tenants' practice in a particular medical field or are reliant upon a particular healthcare delivery system. Accordingly, a downturn in the healthcare industry generally, or a particular medical field or healthcare delivery system specifically, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## The inability of any of our significant tenants to pay rent to us could have a disproportionate negative affect on our business.

As of December 31, 2022, the annualized base rent from our top three tenants represented approximately 18% of our portfolio-wide annualized base  rent,  including  our  LifePoint  Health  facilities,  which  comprised  approximately  7%  of  our  annualized  base  rent;  our  Encompass  facilities,  which comprised approximately 6% of our annualized base rent; and our Memorial Health facilities, which comprised approximately 5% of our annualized base rent.

We have no control over the success or failure of our significant tenants' businesses, and, at any time, our significant tenants may fail to make rent payments when due, which, in turn, may have a disproportionate adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Competition for medical office buildings has increased significantly since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Medical  office  buildings  were  one  of  the  few  real  estate  asset  classes  that  did  not  experience  a  significant  downturn  due  to  the  COVID-19 pandemic.  Although many medical office building tenants did experience some business disruption during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many were able to weather those disruptions and return to normal operations within a short period of time.  This was not the case of many other types of real  estate,  such  as  hospitality,  retail,  and  general  commercial  office  buildings,  which  experienced  significant  tenant  issues  due  to  travel  restrictions, changes in consumer habits during the pandemic and remote working policies instituted by many employers.

The resiliency  of  medical  office  buildings  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  caused  many  real  estate  investors  to  enter  the  market  in  search  of reliable  returns.    This  influx  of  investors  has  caused  medical  office  building  prices  and  competition  to  increase  significantly,  especially  for  Class  A properties in prime locations, but has also caused similar increases in our target markets.  An increase in competition for our acquisition targets could make it more difficult to grow our business, which could affect our ability to increase our distributions and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Our tenants' businesses have in the past  and could again in the future be materially and adversely affected by the effects of the COVID-19 virus, including labor shortages that have resulted from nurses and other medical personnel switching jobs within the medical profession or quitting the medical profession altogether, and other viruses or pandemics could cause similar effects in the future.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the healthcare industry in many ways.  Many stories exist about U.S. healthcare workers, especially nurses, experiencing burnout due to the length and severity of the pandemic, and this has caused many nurses and other medical professionals to switch jobs within the medical profession or quit the profession altogether. This phenomenon has led to material increases in labor costs for healthcare systems, especially hospital systems, as employers have had to rely on contract nursing labor to sustain their businesses. Other viruses or pandemics could cause similar effects in the future.

In October 2022, Pipeline Health Systems, one of our top 10 tenants, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due in part to increases in labor costs  resulting  from  nursing  shortages.    If  these  labor  shortages  are  not  rectified  at  reasonable  cost,  healthcare  practices,  including  our  tenants,  may continue to experience staffing shortages or increased labor and recruitment costs, which could negatively impact their businesses and their ability to pay rents to us.  Additionally, the volatility of COVID-19, its variants and its subvariants are unpredictable and there are no assurances that new variants and subvariants will not emerge in the future.

## Table of Contents

## The COVID-19 pandemic, or other global pandemic in the future, could disrupt our and our third-party advisors' businesses.

In  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  measures  taken  by  applicable  governmental  authorities,  we  have  been  encouraging  all  of  our employees at our corporate office to work remotely until further notice. While we believe these measures are advisable and in the best interests of our employees and communities, such measures, in combination with other factors, have caused disruptions to our normal operations and may continue to do so during the pendency of such measures. Additionally, certain of our service providers have instituted or may institute similar preventative measures or are experiencing labor shortages due to COVID-19, which has resulted in reductions in the availability, capacity and/or efficiency of the services upon which we depend for our operations, including the services we use to complete our property acquisitions. Further, in the event any of our employees, and/or employees of our service providers, contract COVID-19 or are otherwise compelled to self-quarantine, we may experience shortages in labor and services that we require for our operations. Also, remote work arrangements may increase the risk of cybersecurity incidents, data breaches or cyber-attacks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, due to, among other things, the loss of proprietary data, interruptions or delays in the operation of our business and damage to our reputation.

## Our leases are generally long-term leases with annual rent escalators, however, some of our debt financing is subject to floating interest rates. Recent increases in interest rates have not been matched by an increase in our rent payments, which has exposed us to a funding imbalance.

Our revenues are generated by our leases, which are typically medium-to-long-term leases with fixed rental rates, subject to annual rent escalators. The unhedged portion of our Credit Facility debt is subject to SOFR, which has increased substantially since early 2022. The generally fixed nature of revenues and the variable rate of our debt obligations create interest rate risk for us. Increases in interest rates have not been matched by increases in our rental  income,  which  has  increased  our  expenses  and  has  materially  adversely  affected  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  the trading price of our common and preferred stock. Further increases in interest rates may have a material, adverse effect on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

## The bankruptcy of any of our tenants could bar our efforts to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from the tenant or evict the tenant and take back control of the property.

Any bankruptcy filings by or relating to one of our tenants could bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from that tenant or evict the tenant and take back control of the property, unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from a bankruptcy court, which we may be unable to obtain. A tenant bankruptcy could also delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums. If a tenant rejects the lease while in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for pre-petition damages. Any unsecured claim that we hold may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims. It is possible that we may recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims that we hold, or nothing at all, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common stock and preferred stock. Furthermore, dealing with a tenant bankruptcy or other default may divert management's attention and cause us to incur substantial legal and other costs. In October 2022, one of our tenants, Pipeline Health Systems, LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. See 'Business-Recent DevelopmentsChapter 11 Reorganization Filing of Pipeline Health System, LLC ,' for a description of the Pipeline bankruptcy.

## The physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties.

The physical  effects  of  climate  change  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  facilities,  operations,  and  business.  To  the  extent  climate change causes changes in weather patterns, markets where our properties are located could experience increases in storm intensity, rising sea-levels, and changes  in  precipitation,  temperature,  and  air  quality.  Over  time,  these  conditions  could  result  in  physical  damage  to,  or  declining  demand  for,  our properties  or  our  inability  to  operate  the  facilities  at  all.  Climate  change  may  also  indirectly  affect  our  business  by  increasing  the  cost  of  (or  making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy and increasing the risk of flood at our properties. Should the impact of climate change be severe or occur for lengthy periods of time, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock could be materially adversely impacted.

## Table of Contents

## Adverse economic or other conditions in our geographic markets could negatively affect our tenants' ability to pay rent to us.

Adverse economic or other conditions in our geographic markets, including periods of economic slowdown or recession, industry slowdowns, periods of deflation,  relocation  of  businesses,  changing  demographics,  earthquakes  and  other  natural  disasters,  fires,  terrorist  acts,  public  health  crisis, pandemics and epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and civil disturbances or acts of war and other man-made disasters which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses, and changes in tax, real estate, zoning and other laws and regulations, may negatively affect our tenants' businesses and ability to pay rents to us and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

Most of our healthcare facilities are occupied by a single tenant, and we may have difficulty finding suitable replacement tenants in the event of a tenant default or non-renewal of our leases, especially for our healthcare facilities located in smaller markets.

As  of  December  31,  2022,  leases  representing  6.6%,  13.7%  and  7.7%  of  our  portfolio  annualized  base  rent  expire  in  2023,  2024  and  2025, respectively. Most of our healthcare facilities are occupied by a single tenant. Following expiration of a lease term or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant in default, rental payments on the related healthcare facilities could decline or cease altogether while we reposition such healthcare facility with a suitable replacement tenant. We also might not be successful in identifying suitable replacement tenants or entering into triple-net leases with new tenants on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all. Additionally, we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our healthcare facilities while they are being repositioned. Our ability to reposition our healthcare facilities with a suitable tenant could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by the Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules. We could also incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing,  receivership  or  change-of-ownership  proceedings.  In  addition,  our  ability  to  locate  suitable  replacement  tenants  could  be  impaired  by  the specialized healthcare uses or contractual restrictions on use of the healthcare facilities, and we may be required to spend substantial amounts to adapt the healthcare facilities to other uses. Any such delays, limitations and expenses could adversely impact our ability to collect rent, obtain possession of leased healthcare  facilities  or  otherwise  exercise  remedies  for  tenant  default,  which,  in  turn,  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

All of these risks may be greater in smaller markets, where there may be fewer potential replacement tenants, making it more difficult to replace tenants, especially for specialized space.

We have significant geographic concentration in a small number of states, including Texas, Florida, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Illinois. Economic and other conditions that negatively affect those states and our tenants in those states could have a greater effect on our revenues than if our properties were more geographically diverse.

As of December 31, 2022, approximately 18%, 10%, 8%, 6%, 6%, 6% and 6% of our total annualized base rent was derived from properties located  in Texas,  Florida,  Ohio,  Oklahoma,  Pennsylvania,  Arizona,  and  Illinois ,  respectively.  As  a  result  of  this  geographic  concentration,  we  are particularly exposed to downturns in these states' economies or other changes in local real estate market conditions. Any material changes in the current payment  programs  or  regulatory,  economic,  environmental  or  competitive  conditions  in  these  states  could  have  an  amplified  effect  on  our  business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock than if our properties were more geographically diverse.

## Table of Contents

## We may be unable to  successfully  enter  into  definitive  purchase  or  sale  agreements  for,  or  close  the  acquisition  or  sale  of,  the  properties  in  our investment pipeline or our portfolio.

There is no assurance that we will successfully enter into definitive purchase agreements for the facilities in our investment pipeline or definitive sale agreements for current properties we wish to sell. We or a counterparty could also determine through due diligence that a prospective facility does not meet our or their investment standards. We also may be unable to come to an agreement with the seller or buyer for the purchase or sale of the facility. Additionally,  there  is  no  assurance  that  we  will  successfully  close  an  acquisition  or  sale  once  a  purchase  or  sale  agreement  has  been  signed. After  a purchase or sale agreement has been signed, we (or the buyer in the case of a sale transaction) typically have a due diligence period of 45 to 60 days. If we or a buyer identify problems with the property or the operator during our or their due diligence review, we may or they may terminate the purchase or sale agreement and not close. Failure to close acquisitions or dispositions under contract could make it more difficult to grow or manage our portfolio, which could materially adversely affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## We may obtain only limited warranties when we purchase a property, which, in turn, would only provide us with limited recourse against the seller if issues arise after our purchase of a property.

The seller of a property often sells such property in its 'as is' condition on a 'where is' basis and 'with all faults,' without any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose. In addition, purchase and sale agreements may contain only limited warranties, representations and indemnifications that will only survive for a limited period after the closing. The purchase of properties with limited warranties increases the risk of having little or no recourse against a seller if issues were to arise at such property. This, in turn, could cause us to have to write off our investment in the property, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Our healthcare buildings that are subject to ground leases could restrict our use of such healthcare facilities.

We have seven buildings located on land that is subject  to  operating  ground  leases,  representing  approximately  4.2%  of  our  December  2022 annualized  base  rent.  These  ground  leases  contain  certain  restrictions.  These  restrictions  include  limits  on  our  ability  to  re-let  the  facilities,  rights  of purchase and rights of first offer and refusal with respect to sales of the healthcare facility and limits on the types of medical procedures that may be performed at the facilities. These restrictions could affect our returns on these facilities which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Our healthcare facilities and our tenants may be unable to compete successfully, which could negatively affect our tenants' businesses and ability to pay rent to us.

Our healthcare facilities often face competition from nearby hospitals and other healthcare facilities that provide comparable services, including urgent care and primary care facilities as well as home healthcare companies. These competitors may have greater geographic coverage, better access to physicians and patients and provide or are perceived to provide higher quality services. From time to time and for reasons beyond our control, managed care  organizations  may  change  their  lists  of  preferred  hospitals  or  in-network  physicians,  which  may  favor  our  tenants'  competitors.  Furthermore,  our tenants may lose physicians to their competitors or an increase in telehealth services could reduce the need for healthcare facilities. Any reduction in rental revenues resulting from the inability of our tenants or their associated healthcare delivery systems to compete or due to a reduced need for healthcare facilities generally may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Table of Contents

## We may incur uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which may result in us having to absorb all or a portion of such loss.

Our tenants are generally required (either directly or through a reimbursement arrangement with us) to maintain comprehensive property and casualty insurance covering our properties. However, some types of losses may be uninsurable or too expensive to insure against, such as losses due to windstorms, terrorist acts, earthquakes, and toxic mold, among others. Accordingly, we may not have enough insurance coverage against certain types of losses and may experience decreases in the insurance coverage available. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of our investment in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. In such an event, we might remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligation related to the property. Further, if any of our insurance carriers were to become insolvent, we would be forced to replace the existing coverage with another suitable carrier, and any outstanding claims would be at risk for collection. In such an event, we cannot be certain that we would be able to replace the coverage at similar or otherwise favorable terms.

We have obtained title insurance policies for each of our properties, typically in an amount equal to its original price. However, these policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of our properties. In such an event, if there is a title defect relating to any of our properties, we could lose some of our investment in and anticipated profits from such property.

If we were to experience uninsured losses or if any of our insurance carriers were unable to pay insurance claims, we may lose all or a portion of our investment in a property and the revenues associated with such property, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## We may incur environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with owning, leasing, developing and operating our healthcare facilities.

Under various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, current and prior owners and tenants of healthcare facilities may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigating, remediating and monitoring certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such healthcare facility. In addition to these costs, the past or present owner or tenant of a healthcare facility from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injury or property damage that results from such releases, including for the unauthorized release of asbestos-containing materials and other hazardous substances into the air, as well as any damages to natural resources or the environment that arise from such releases. These environmental laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the current or prior owner or tenant knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such substances or materials. Moreover, the release of hazardous substances or materials, or the failure to properly remediate such substances or materials, may adversely affect the owner's or tenant's ability to lease, sell, develop or rent such healthcare facility or to borrow against such healthcare facility. Persons who transport or arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility, regardless of whether such facility is owned or operated by such person.

Certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and tenants of real property with respect to the management of hazardous substances and other regulated materials. For example, environmental laws govern the management and removal of asbestos-containing materials and leadbased paint. Failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions. If we are held liable under these laws, our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock may be materially adversely affected.

## Table of Contents

## The income from certain of our properties is dependent on the ability of our property managers to successfully manage those properties.

We depend upon the performance of our property managers to effectively manage certain of our properties. We do not control these third-party property managers and are accordingly subject to various risks generally associated with outsourcing of management of day-to-day activities, including the risk that a property manager may not be able to successfully manage a property. Additionally, because we do not control our third-party property managers, any  adverse  events  such  as  issues  related  to  insufficient  internal  controls,  cybersecurity  incidents  or  other  adverse  events  may  impact  the  income  we recognize from properties managed by such third-party property managers. We may be unable to anticipate such events or properly assess the magnitude of any such events because we do not control our third-party property managers. If our property managers are unable to successfully manage our properties, our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock may be materially adversely affected.

## We, our tenants, and our property managers face risks associated with security breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber-intrusions, or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of information technology networks and related systems.

We and our tenants face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to emails, company insiders, or persons with access to our and our tenants' systems, and other significant disruptions of our and our tenants' information technology ('IT') networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or  cyber-intrusion,  including  by  computer  hackers,  foreign  governments  and  cyber-terrorists,  has  generally  increased  as  the  number,  intensity,  and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our and our tenants' IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of each of our businesses and our and our tenants' ability to perform day-to-day operations (including maintaining confidential patient data). Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that these security measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Additionally, our tenants may not have enough risk mitigation measures in place or, even if they do, such measures may not be effective. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems, and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and may not be detected. Accordingly, we and our tenants may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and it is therefore impossible to entirely mitigate the risk.

A security breach or other significant disruption involving our or our tenants' IT networks and related systems could:

- ● Disrupt the proper functioning of our or our tenants' networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of our tenants;
- ● Result  in  the  unauthorized  access  to,  and  destruction,  loss,  theft,  misappropriation  or  release  of  proprietary,  confidential,  sensitive,  or otherwise valuable information about us, our tenants or our tenants' patients, which others could use to compete against us or our tenants or which could expose us or our tenants to regulatory action or damage claims by third-parties;
- ● Result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants, missed reporting deadlines, and/or missed permitting deadlines;
- ● Result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a REIT;
- ● Jeopardize the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space;
- ● Require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result;
- ● Subject us or our tenants to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties, or termination of leases or other agreements; or

## Table of Contents

- ● Damage our and our tenants' reputations.

Any or all the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Risks Related to our Financings

We finance a portion of our portfolio with unhedged floating- rate debt from our Credit Facility. The rapid increase in inflation during 2022 led to a rapid increase in market interest rates, which materially increased the interest rate on our floating rate debt.  In addition to interest rate risk, we are subject to additional risks associated with our Credit Facility generally, including covenant restrictions.

As of December 31, 2022, the balance of the revolver component of our Credit Facility (the 'Revolver') was $145.7 million, which represented approximately 21% of our total outstanding indebtedness at December 31, 2022. The rapid increase in inflation during 2022 has led to a dramatic increase in market interest rates as the Fed has implemented a series of interest rate increases to curb the inflation rate. As a result, the One-Month Term SOFR, which serves as the base rate for the Revolver, increased from just over 0% at the start of the year to 4.32% in December 2022 and has continued to increase in 2023 to date. Additionally SOFR is currently forecasted to increase to approximately 5.40% by August 2023 (based on the term SOFR forward curve as of February 24, 2023), or approximately 108 basis points (1.08%) from our SOFR rate as of December 31, 2022. The recent increase in interest rates has caused our borrowing costs to materially increase, which has, among other things, increased our cost of capital (which has affected our ability to acquire assets) and decreased our earnings, liquidity, cash available to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

The terms of our debt agreements require us to comply with several customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining certain leverage and coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth requirements. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources' for a description of these covenants. Our continued ability to incur additional debt, make distributions and conduct business in general is subject to our compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. Breaches of these covenants could result  in  defaults  under  the  instruments  governing  the  applicable  indebtedness,  in  addition  to  any  other  indebtedness  cross-defaulted  against  such instruments, which could accelerate the principal balance of our debt and cause our lenders to institute foreclosure proceedings against us. Therefore, any such  default  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations,  our  ability  to  make  distributions  to  our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Our interest rate hedges may not be successful in mitigating our interest rate risks.

We use derivative instruments to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates on certain of our variable rate loans. As of December 31, 2022, we had 15 interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $500 million that fixed the SOFR component of the interest rate on the $350 million and $150 million term loan components under our Credit Facility (the 'Term Loans'). There is no assurance that our hedging instruments will adequately mitigate our interest rate risk or that our hedging strategy will not result in losses. Additionally, a hedging counterparty may fail to honor its obligations to us.  If  our  interest  rate  hedges  are  unsuccessful  in  mitigating  our  interest  rate  risk,  or  if  a  hedging  counterparty  fails  to  honor  its  obligations  to  us,  our borrowing costs would increase, which could, among other things, increase our cost of capital and decrease our earnings, liquidity, cash available to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

We finance our healthcare facilities with term indebtedness, and we may place term indebtedness on our healthcare facilities in the future. We may not be able to refinance such debt when due or may be unable to refinance such debt on favorable terms.

As  of  December  31,  2022,  we  had  $694.1  million  of  indebtedness  outstanding  (net  of  unamortized  debt  issuance  costs).  We  may  also  place indebtedness on our healthcare facilities in the future. We run the risk of being unable to refinance such debt (including our Credit Facility debt) when the loans come due or of being unable to refinance on favorable terms. If interest rates are higher when we refinance debt, our income could be reduced. We may be unable to refinance debt at appropriate times, which may require us to sell healthcare facilities on terms that are not advantageous to us or could result in the foreclosure of such healthcare facilities. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

We rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs, and, if we encounter difficulty in obtaining such capital, we may not be able to make future acquisitions necessary to grow our business or meet maturing obligations.

To qualify as a REIT, we are required, among other things, to distribute each year to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund our future capital  needs  from  cash  retained  from  operations,  including  capital  needed  to  make  investments  and  to  satisfy  or  refinance  maturing  obligations. As  a result, we expect to rely on external sources of capital, including debt and equity financing, to fund future capital needs. Our access to capital will depend upon several factors, many of which we have little or no control, including:

- ● The extent of investor interest;
- ● Our ability to satisfy the distribution requirements applicable to REITs;
- ● The general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based companies;
- ● Our financial performance and that of our tenants;
- ● Analyst reports about us and the REIT industry;
- ● General  stock  and  bond  market  conditions,  including  changes  in  interest  rates  on  fixed  income  securities,  which  may  lead  prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future distributions;
- ● A failure to maintain or increase our dividend which is dependent, in large part, upon our funds from operations, or FFO, which, in turn, depends upon increased revenue from additional acquisitions and rental increases; and
- ● Other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws.

If  we  are  unable  to  obtain  needed  capital  on  satisfactory  terms  or  at  all,  we  may  not  be  able  to  make  the  investments  needed  to  expand  our business or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Risks Related to the Healthcare Industry

## Adverse trends in the healthcare industry may negatively affect our tenants' businesses.

The healthcare industry is currently experiencing, among other things:

- ● Changes in the demand for and methods of delivering healthcare services;
- ● Competition among healthcare providers;
- ● Consolidation of large health insurers;
- ● Regulatory and government reimbursement uncertainty resulting from the Affordable Care Act and other healthcare reform laws;
- ● Federal court decisions on cases challenging the legality of the Affordable Care Act;
- ● Federal and state government plans to reduce budget deficits and address debt ceiling limits by lowering healthcare provider Medicare and Medicaid payment rates;
- ● Changes in third-party reimbursement methods and policies; and

## Table of Contents

- ● Increased scrutiny of billing, referral and other practices by U.S. federal and state authorities.

These factors may adversely affect the economic performance of some or all of our tenants and, in turn, our lease revenues, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and new laws or regulations, changes to existing laws or regulations, loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could result in the inability of our tenants to make rent payments to us.

The healthcare industry is heavily regulated by U.S. federal, state, and local governmental authorities. Our tenants generally are subject to laws and regulations covering, among other things, licensure, certification for participation in government programs, billing for services, privacy and security of health  information  and  relationships  with  physicians  and  other  referral  sources.  See  'Business-Government  Programs,  Laws  and  Regulations'  for  a description of the laws and regulations that affect the healthcare industry. In addition, new laws and regulations, changes in existing laws and regulations or changes in the interpretation of such laws or regulations could affect our tenants' ability to make rent payments to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock. These changes, in some cases, could apply retroactively. The enactment, timing, or effect of legislative or regulatory changes cannot be predicted.

Violations  of  healthcare  laws  may  result  in  criminal  and/or  civil  penalties  that  range  from  punitive  sanctions,  damage  assessments,  penalties, imprisonment,  denial  of  Medicare  and  Medicaid  payments  and/or  exclusion  from  the  Medicare  and  Medicaid  programs.  Imposition  of  any  of  these penalties  upon  one  of  our  tenants  could  jeopardize  that  tenants'  ability  to  operate  or  to  make  rent  payments  or  affect  the  level  of  occupancy  in  our healthcare  facilities,  which  may  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations,  our  ability  to  make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Reductions in reimbursement from third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, could adversely affect the profitability of our tenants and hinder their ability to make rent payments to us or renew their leases.

Sources of revenue for our tenants typically include the U.S. federal Medicare program, state Medicaid programs and private insurance payors. Healthcare providers continue to face increased government and private payor pressure to control or reduce healthcare costs and significant reductions in healthcare  reimbursement,  including  reduced  reimbursements  and  changes  to  payment  methodologies  under  the Affordable  Care Act.  In  some  cases, private insurers rely on all or portions of the Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates, which may result in decreased reimbursement from private insurers. Any reductions in payments or reimbursements from third-party payors could adversely affect the reimbursement rates received by our tenants, the financial success of our tenants and strategic partners and, therefore, our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

Downturns in the United States economy could negatively affect state budgets, thereby putting pressure on states to decrease spending on state programs including Medicaid. The need to control Medicaid expenditures may be exacerbated by the potential for increased enrollment in state Medicaid programs due to unemployment and declines in family incomes. Historically, states have often attempted to reduce Medicaid spending by limiting benefits and tightening Medicaid eligibility requirements. Many states have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, legislation designed to enroll Medicaid recipients  in  managed  care  programs  and/or  impose  additional  taxes  on  hospitals  to  help  finance  or  expand  the  states'  Medicaid  systems.  Potential reductions to Medicaid program spending in response to state budgetary pressures could negatively impact the ability of our tenants to successfully operate their businesses, and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Table of Contents

Our tenants may be subject to significant legal actions that could subject them to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which may affect their ability to pay their rent payments to us, and we could also be subject to healthcare industry violations.

As is typical in the healthcare industry, our tenants may often become subject to claims that their services have resulted in patient injury or other adverse effects. Many of these tenants may have experienced an increasing trend in the frequency and severity of professional liability and general liability insurance claims and litigation asserted against them. The insurance coverage maintained by these tenants may not cover all claims made against them nor continue to be available at a reasonable cost, if at all. In some states, insurance coverage for the risk of punitive damages arising from professional liability and  general  liability  claims  and/or  litigation  may  not,  in  certain  cases,  be  available  to  these  tenants  due  to  state  law  prohibitions  or  limitations  of availability. As a result, these types of tenants of our healthcare facilities operating in these states may be liable for punitive damage awards that are either not covered or are in excess of their insurance policy limits.

We  also  believe  that  there  has  been,  and  will  continue  to  be,  an  increase  in  governmental  investigations  of  certain  healthcare  providers, particularly in the area of Medicare/Medicaid false claims, as well as an increase in enforcement actions resulting from these investigations. Insurance is not available to cover such losses. Any adverse determination in a legal proceeding or governmental investigation, any settlements of such proceedings or investigations  in  excess  of  insurance  coverage,  whether  currently  asserted  or  arising  in  the  future,  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  a  tenant's financial  condition.  If  a  tenant  is  unable  to  obtain  or  maintain  insurance  coverage,  if  judgments  are  obtained  or  settlements  reached  in  excess  of  the insurance coverage, if a tenant is required to pay uninsured punitive damages, or if a tenant is subject to an uninsurable government enforcement action or investigation, the tenant could be exposed to substantial additional liabilities, which may affect the tenant's ability to pay rent, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry

## Changes in the general real estate market conditions may adversely affect us.

Real estate investments are subject to various risks and fluctuations and cycles in value and demand, many of which are beyond our control. Certain market conditions that may affect our business are as follows:

- ● National or regional economic upturns could increase the value of real estate generally, which could make it more difficult for us to acquire new healthcare properties at attractive prices or prevent us from purchasing additional facilities at all;
- ● National or regional economic downturns could adversely affect our tenants' businesses, or the businesses located in our tenants' geographic region, which could adversely affect our tenants' ability to pay rent and the value of our healthcare properties;
- ● A decrease in interest rates and financing costs could increase demand for real estate and, thus, the price of real estate. An increase in demand for real estate could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional healthcare facilities at attractive prices or prevent us from purchasing additional facilities at all; and
- ● An increase in interest rates and financing costs could decrease the demand for real estate and, thus, the price of real estate. A decrease in demand for  real  estate  could  make  it  more  difficult  for  us  to  dispose  of  our  healthcare  facilities  at  attractive  prices  or  prevent  us  from disposing of our facilities at all.

If we experience one or more of the risks described above, our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock could be materially adversely affected.

## Table of Contents

## Illiquidity  of  real  estate  investments  could  significantly  impede  our  ability  to  respond  to  adverse  changes  in  the  performance  of  our  healthcare facilities.

Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more of our healthcare facilities in response to changing economic,  financial  and  investment  conditions  is  limited.  The  real  estate  market  is  affected  by  many  factors,  such  as  general  economic  conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any of our healthcare facilities for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of any of our healthcare facilities. We may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a healthcare facility can be sold. We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements.

In acquiring a healthcare facility, we have in the past and may in the future agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that healthcare  facility  for  a  period  of  time  or  impose  other  restrictions,  such  as  a  limitation  on  the  amount  of  debt  that  can  be  placed  or  repaid  on  that healthcare facility. These transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a healthcare facility even if we deem it necessary or appropriate. These facts and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our healthcare facilities may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Uncertain market conditions could cause us to sell our healthcare facilities at a loss in the future.

We intend to hold our various real estate investments until we determine that a sale or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve our investment objectives. We may exercise our discretion as to whether and when to sell a healthcare facility, and we have no obligation to sell our facilities. We generally  intend  to  hold  our  healthcare  facilities  for  an  extended  period,  and  we  cannot  predict  with  any  certainty  the  various  market  conditions affecting real estate investments that will exist at any particular time in the future. Because of the uncertainty of market conditions that may affect the future disposition of our healthcare facilities, we may not be able to sell our buildings at a profit in the future or at all. We may incur prepayment penalties if we sell a healthcare facility subject to a mortgage earlier than we otherwise had planned. Additionally, we could be forced to sell healthcare facilities at inopportune times which could result in us selling the affected building at a substantial loss. Any inability to sell a healthcare facility could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Our assets may become subject to impairment charges.

We  periodically  evaluate  our  real  estate  investments  and  other  assets  for  impairment  indicators.  The  judgment  regarding  the  existence  of impairment indicators is based upon factors such as market conditions, lease re-negotiations, tenant performance and legal structure. For example, the termination of a lease by a major tenant may lead to an impairment charge. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to make an adjustment to  the  net  carrying  value  of  the  asset  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of operations and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Risks Related to Our Structure

## We have no direct operations and rely on funds received from our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries to meet our obligations.

We conduct substantially all of our operations through our Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 93.97% of the outstanding OP Units. Apart from this ownership interest in our Operating Partnership, we do not have any independent operations. As a result, we rely on distributions from our Operating Partnership to pay any dividends that we might declare on our common and preferred stock. We also rely on distributions from our Operating Partnership to meet our obligations. Stockholders' claims will consequently be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations (whether or not for borrowed money) of our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization,  claims  of  our  stockholders  will  be  satisfied  only  after  all  of  our  and  our  Operating  Partnership's  and  its  subsidiaries'  liabilities  and obligations have been paid in full. If we do not receive enough funds from our Operating Partnership, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock may be materially, adversely affected.

## Table of Contents

Subject to certain requirements under Maryland law and REIT requirements, the Board has sole discretion to determine if we will pay distributions and the amount and frequency of such distributions, and past distribution amounts may not be indicative of future distribution amounts.

Any future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board and will depend upon a number of factors, including our actual and projected results  of  operations,  the  cash  flow  generated  by  our  operations,  funds  from  operations  ('FFO'),  adjusted  FFO  ('AFFO'),  liquidity,  our  operating expenses, our debt service requirements, capital expenditure requirements for the properties in our portfolio, prohibitions and other limitations under our financing arrangements, our REIT taxable income, the annual REIT distribution requirements, restrictions on making distributions under Maryland law and such other factors as the Board deems relevant. We cannot assure you that our distribution policy will not change in the future or that the Board will continue to declare dividends at the same rate as in 2022.

## Our use of OP Units as currency to acquire healthcare facilities could result in stockholder dilution and/or limit our ability to sell such healthcare facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on us.

We have  acquired,  and  in  the  future  may  acquire,  healthcare  facilities  or  portfolios  of  healthcare  facilities  through  tax-deferred  contribution transactions in exchange for OP Units, which may result in stockholder dilution. This acquisition structure may have the effect of, among other things, reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired healthcare facilities, and has required, and may in the future require, that we agree to protect the contributors' ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired healthcare facilities or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. These restrictions could limit our ability to sell healthcare facilities at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions which, in turn, could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

Our  Operating  Partnership  may  issue  additional  OP  Units  to  third  parties  without  the  consent  of  our  stockholders,  which  would  reduce  our ownership percentage in our Operating Partnership and could have a dilutive effect on the amount of distributions made to us by our Operating Partnership and, therefore, the amount of distributions we can make to our stockholders.

Holders of shares of our common stock will generally not have any voting rights with respect to activities of our Operating Partnership, including issuances of additional OP Units in amounts that do not exceed 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 93.97%  of  the  outstanding  OP  Units.  Our  Operating  Partnership  may,  in  connection  with  our  acquisition  of  healthcare  facilities  or  otherwise,  issue additional OP Units to third parties. Such issuances would reduce our ownership percentage in our Operating Partnership and could affect the amount of distributions made to us by our Operating Partnership and, therefore, the amount of distributions we can make to our stockholders.

## We may be unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting.

Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of such controls. Because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention  or  overriding  of  controls,  or  fraud,  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements  and  can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal  controls,  including  any  failure  to  implement  required  new  or  improved  controls  as  a  result  of  changes  to  our  business  or  otherwise,  or  if  we experience  difficulties  in  their  implementation,  our  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition,  our  ability  to  make  distributions  to  our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock could be materially adversely impacted and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations.

## Table of Contents

## Conflicts of interest could arise because of our UPREIT structure.

Conflicts of interest could arise because of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and our Operating Partnership or any partner thereof,  on  the  other.  Our  directors  and  officers  have  duties  to  us  under  applicable  Maryland  law  in  connection  with  their  management  of  our company. At the same time, we, as the sole member of the general partner of the Operating Partnership, have fiduciary duties to our Operating Partnership and to the limited partners under Delaware law in connection with the management of our Operating Partnership. Our duties, as the sole member of the general partner, to our Operating Partnership and its limited partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to us.

Unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement, Delaware law generally requires a general partner of a Delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith, fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibits such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest.

Additionally,  the  partnership  agreement  expressly  limits  our  liability  by  providing  that  we,  as  the  sole  member  of  the  general  partner  of  the Operating Partnership, and our directors or officers, will not be liable or accountable in damages to our Operating Partnership, the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment, mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if the general partner or such director or officer acted in good faith. In addition,  our  Operating  Partnership  is  required  to  indemnify  us,  our  affiliates  and  each  of  our  respective  officers  and  directors,  to  the  fullest  extent permitted  by  applicable  law  against  any  and  all  losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities  (whether  joint  or  several),  expenses  (including,  without  limitation, attorneys' fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or  proceedings,  civil,  criminal,  administrative  or  investigative,  that  relate  to  the  operations  of  our  Operating  Partnership,  provided  that  our  Operating Partnership will not indemnify any such person for (1) acts or omissions committed in bad faith or that were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (2) any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in money, healthcare facility or services, or (3) in the case of a criminal proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful.

## Our charter restricts the ownership and transfer of our outstanding shares of stock which may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or change of control of our company.

For us to qualify as a REIT, no more than 50% of the value of our outstanding shares of stock may be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year other than our initial REIT taxable year. Subject to certain exceptions, our charter prohibits any stockholder from owning actually or constructively more than 9.8% in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of any class or series of our outstanding shares. The constructive ownership rules under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code'), are complex and may cause the outstanding  shares  owned  by  a  group  of  related  individuals  or  entities  to  be  deemed  to  be  constructively  owned  by  one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding shares of any class or series by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity to own constructively in excess of 9.8% of any class or series of our outstanding beneficial interests and to be subject to our charter's ownership limit. Our charter also prohibits any person from owning shares of our beneficial interests that would result in our being 'closely held' under Section 856(h) of the Code or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. Any attempt to own or transfer shares of our beneficial interest in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void.

## Table of Contents

Certain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes of control, which may discourage third parties from conducting a tender offer or seeking other change of control transactions that could involve a premium price for shares of our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interests.

Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or MGCL, may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide our common stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of such shares, including:

- ● 'business  combination'  provisions  that,  subject  to  limitations,  prohibit  certain  business  combinations  between  us  and  an  'interested stockholder' (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our shares of common stock or an affiliate thereof or an affiliate or associate of ours who was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of our shares of common stock at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question) for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes certain fair price and/or supermajority and stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and
- ● 'control share' provisions that provide that holders of 'control shares' of our company (defined as shares that, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired  in  a  'control  share  acquisition'  (defined  as  the  direct  or  indirect  acquisition  of  ownership  or  control  of  issued  and  outstanding 'control  shares')  have  no  voting  rights  with  respect  to  their  control  shares,  except  to  the  extent  approved  by  our  stockholders  by  the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.

By resolution of the Board, we have opted out of the business combination provisions of the MGCL and provide that any business combination between  us  and  any  other  person  is  exempt  from  the  business  combination  provisions  of  the  MGCL,  provided  that  the  business  combination  is  first approved by the Board (including a majority of directors who are not affiliates or associates of such persons). In addition, pursuant to a provision in our bylaws, we have opted out of the control share provisions of the MGCL. However, the Board may by resolution elect to opt into the business combination provisions of the MGCL and we may, by amendment to our bylaws, opt into the control share provisions of the MGCL in the future.

Certain provisions of the MGCL permit the Board, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws,  to  implement  certain  corporate  governance  provisions,  some  of  which  (for  example,  a  classified  board)  are  not  currently  applicable  to  us.  If implemented, these provisions may have the effect of limiting or precluding a third party from making an unsolicited acquisition proposal for us or of delaying,  deferring,  or  preventing  a  change  in  control  of  us  under  circumstances  that  otherwise  could  provide  our  common  stockholders  with  the opportunity  to  realize  a  premium  over  the  then  current  market  price.  Our  charter  contains  a  provision  whereby  we  have  elected  to  be  subject  to  the provisions of Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL relating to the filling of vacancies on the Board.

## We could increase the number of authorized shares of common and preferred stock, classify and reclassify unissued shares and issue shares without stockholder approval.

The Board, without stockholder approval, has the power under our charter to amend our charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares or the number of shares of any class or series that we are authorized to issue, to authorize us to issue authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock. In addition, under our charter, the Board has the power to classify or reclassify any unissued common or preferred stock into one or more classes or series of shares and set the preference, conversion, or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption for such newly classified or reclassified shares. As a result, we may issue series or classes of common or preferred stock with preferences, dividends, powers and rights, voting or otherwise, that are senior to, or otherwise conflict with, the rights of holders of our common or preferred stock. Although the Board has no such intention at the present time, it could establish a class or series of preferred stock that could, depending on the terms of such series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for shares of our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interests.

## Table of Contents

## We may change our business, investment, and financing strategies without stockholder approval.

We may change our business, investment, and financing strategies without a vote of, or notice to, our stockholders, which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments and businesses described in this annual report. In particular, a change in our investment strategy, including the manner in which we allocate our resources across our portfolio or the types of assets in which we seek to invest, may increase our exposure to real estate market fluctuations. In addition, we may in the future increase the use of leverage at times and in amounts that we, in our discretion, deem prudent, and such decision would not be subject to stockholder approval. Furthermore, the Board may determine that healthcare facilities do not offer the potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns for an investment strategy. Changes to our strategies with regards to the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited, which could limit your recourse in the event that we take certain actions which are not in your best interests.

Under Maryland law, generally, directors and officers are required to perform their duties in good faith, in a manner that they reasonably believe to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. Under Maryland law, directors  and  officers  are  presumed  to  have  acted  with  this  standard  of  care.  Maryland  law  permits  a  Maryland  corporation  to  include  in  its  charter  a provision limiting the liability of its directors and officers to the corporation and its stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from (a) actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property, or services or (b) active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action. Our charter contains such a provision which eliminates directors' and officers' liability to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law.

Our charter authorizes us to indemnify our present and former directors and officers for actions taken by them in those and other capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. Our bylaws obligate us to indemnify each present and former director or officer, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of his or her service to us. In addition, we may be obligated to advance the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers. We have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and officers granting them express indemnification rights. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent the current provisions in our charter, bylaws and indemnification agreements or that might exist with other companies.

Our charter contains provisions that make removal of our directors difficult, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to effect changes to our management and may prevent a change in control of our company that is in the best interests of our stockholders. Our charter provides that a director may only be removed for cause upon the affirmative vote of holders of two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. Vacancies may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors in office, even if less than a quorum. These requirements make it more difficult to change our management by removing and replacing directors and may prevent a change in control of our company that is in the best interests of our stockholders.

## Certain provisions in the partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership may delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions of us.

Provisions in the partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership may delay, or make more difficult, unsolicited acquisitions of us or changes of our control. These provisions could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an unsolicited acquisition of us or change of our control, although some stockholders might consider such proposals, if made, desirable. These provisions include, among others:

- ● Redemption rights;
- ● A requirement that we may not be removed as the general partner of our Operating Partnership without our consent;
- ● Transfer restrictions on OP Units;

## Table of Contents

- ● Our ability, as the sole member of the general partner of our Operating Partnership, in some cases, to amend the partnership agreement and to cause the Operating Partnership to issue units with terms that could delay, defer or prevent a merger or other change of control of us or our Operating Partnership without the consent of the limited partners; and
- ● The right of the limited partners to consent to direct or indirect transfers of the general partnership interest, including as a result of a merger or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, in the event that such transfer requires approval by our common stockholders.

Our charter and bylaws, Maryland law and the partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership also contain other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our shares of common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest.

## We may be unable to obtain or retain key personnel or continue to remain appropriately staffed.

Our success depends to a significant degree upon our executive officers and other key personnel. We rely on the services of Jeffrey Busch, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board; Robert Kiernan, our Chief Financial Officer; Alfonzo Leon, our Chief Investment Officer; Danica Holley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jamie Barber, our Secretary and General Counsel, to manage our operations. Additionally, we rely on several other key personnel to manage our day-to-day operations, including accounting and finance staff, acquisition and due diligence personnel, asset managers and  facilities  personnel.    We  cannot  guarantee  that  all,  or  any  one  of  these  key  personnel,  will  remain  affiliated  with  us,  especially  given  the  current tightness of the U.S. labor market, nor do we maintain key person life insurance on any person. Our failure to retain key employees and retain highly skilled  managerial  and  operational  personnel,  especially  during  a  time  of  rapid  growth  for  our  business,  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Risks Related to Our Qualification and Operation as a REIT

## Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for distributions to our stockholders.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for distributions to our stockholders because:

- ● We would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates;
- ● We could be subject to increased state and local taxes; and
- ● Unless we are entitled to relief under certain U.S. federal income tax laws, we could not re-elect REIT status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT.

In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will no longer be required to make distributions. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify  as  a  REIT  could  impair  our  ability  to  expand  our  business  and  raise  capital,  and  it  could  materially,  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Table of Contents

## Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities that could reduce our cash flows and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.

Even if we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, taxes on income from some activities conducted because of a foreclosure, and state or local income, property, and transfer taxes. In addition, our taxable REIT subsidiary ('TRS') will be subject to regular corporate U.S. federal, state, and local taxes. In addition, if our TRS borrows funds either from us or a third party, it may be unable to deduct all or a portion of the interest paid, resulting in a higher corporate-level tax liability. Specifically, the Code imposes a disallowance of deductions for business interest expense (even if paid to third parties) in excess of the sum of a taxpayer's business interest income and 30% of the adjusted taxable income of the business, which is its taxable income computed without regard to business interest income or expense, net operating losses or the pass-through income deduction. The TRS rules also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's-length basis. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to our stockholders, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Failure to make required distributions would subject us to U.S. federal corporate income tax.

To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain, each year to our stockholders. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the Code. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to our stockholders which, in turn, could  materially  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations,  our  ability  to  make  distributions  to  our  stockholders  and  the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Recharacterization of sale-leaseback transactions may cause us to lose our REIT status.

We have engaged, and expect to engage in the future, in transactions in which we purchase healthcare facilities and lease them back to the sellers of such healthcare facilities. Although we have structured, and intend to continue to structure, any such sale-leaseback transaction so that the lease will be characterized  as  a  'true  lease'  for  tax  purposes,  thereby  allowing  us  to  be  treated  as  the  owner  of  the  healthcare  facility  for  U.S.  federal  income  tax purposes, we cannot assure you that the Internal Revenue Service (the 'IRS') will not challenge such characterization. If any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, all of the payments that we receive from the tenant may not be treated as qualifying income for the 75% or 95% gross income tests required for REIT qualification and we may fail to qualify as a REIT as a result. If any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged as a financing transaction or loan for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would not be treated as the owner of the applicable healthcare facility and our deductions for depreciation and cost recovery relating to such healthcare facility would be disallowed. As a result, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated, which might cause us to fail to meet the distribution requirement required for REIT qualification. Although we may be able to cure such failure by making a distribution in a subsequent taxable year and paying an interest charge, no assurance can be provided that we will be able to make the required distribution or pay the required interest charge. If we lose our REIT status, our business, financial condition, results of operations,  ability  to  make  distributions  to  our  stockholders  and  the  trading  price  of  our  common  and  preferred  stock  could  be  materially  adversely affected.

## Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.

To maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our shares of stock. To meet these tests, we may be required to forego investments we might otherwise make. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our performance.

## Table of Contents

We must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified real estate assets. The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities, securities of TRSs and qualified real estate assets)  generally  cannot  include  more  than  10%  of  the  outstanding  voting  securities  of  any  one  issuer  or  more  than  10%  of  the  total  value  of  the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets (other than government securities, securities of TRSs and qualified real estate assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, no more than 20% of the value of our total assets can be represented by the securities of one or more TRSs, and no more than 25% of our assets can be represented by debt of 'publicly offered REITs' (i.e., REITs that are required to file annual and periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act) that is not secured by real property or interests in real property. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify  for  certain  statutory  relief  provisions  to  avoid  losing  our  REIT  qualification  and  suffering  adverse  tax  consequences. As  a  result,  we  may  be required  to  liquidate  otherwise  attractive  investments.  These  actions  could  materially  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Certain taxes may limit our ability to dispose of our healthcare facilities.

A REIT's net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. We may be subject to the prohibited transaction tax equal to 100% of net gain upon a disposition of real property. Although a safe harbor to the characterization of the sale of real property by a REIT as a prohibited transaction is available, we cannot assure you that we can comply with the safe harbor or that we will avoid owning property that may be characterized as held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Consequently, we may choose not to engage in certain sales of our healthcare facilities or may conduct such sales through a TRS, which would be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxation.

## We may pay taxable dividends in our common stock and cash, in which case stockholders may sell shares of our common stock to pay tax on such dividends, placing downward pressure on the market price of our common stock.

We  may  satisfy  the  90%  distribution  test  with  taxable  distributions  of  our  common  stock.  The  IRS  has  issued  Revenue  Procedure  2017-45 authorizing elective cash/stock dividends to be made by publicly offered REITs. Pursuant to Revenue Procedure 2017-45,the IRS will treat the distribution of stock pursuant to an elective cash/stock dividend as a distribution of property under Section 301 of the Code (i.e., a dividend), as long as at least 20% of the total dividend is available in cash and certain other parameters detailed in the Revenue Procedure are satisfied.

Although we have no current intention of paying dividends in our common stock, if we make a taxable dividend payable in cash and common stock, taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, stockholders may be required to pay income tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the common stock that it receives as a dividend to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in common stock. If we make a taxable dividend payable in cash and our common stock and a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock.

## The ability of the Board to revoke our REIT qualification without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders.

Our  charter  provides  that  the  Board  may  revoke  or  otherwise  terminate  our  REIT  election,  without  the  approval  of  our  stockholders,  if  it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders, which could materially adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Table of Contents

## Our ownership of our TRS is subject to limitations and our transactions with our TRS will cause us to be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if those transactions are not conducted on arm's-length terms.

Overall, no more than 20% of the value of a REIT's assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs. Several provisions of the Code regarding the arrangements between a REIT and its TRSs ensure that a TRS will be subject to an appropriate level of U.S. federal income taxation. For example, the Code imposes a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's-length basis. In addition, any income earned by a TRS that is attributable to services provided to its parent REIT, or on the REIT's behalf to any of its tenants, that is less than the amounts that would have been charged based upon arm's-length negotiations, will also be subject to a 100% excise tax. We will monitor the value of our investment in our TRS and any other TRS we may form for the purpose of ensuring compliance with TRS ownership limitations and will structure our transactions with any such TRS on terms that we believe are arm's length to avoid incurring the 100% excise taxes described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the 20% limitation or to avoid application of the 100% excise taxes. If we are subject to either 100% excise tax, our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock could be materially adversely affected.

## The formation of a TRS lessee would increase our overall tax liability.

We may, in the future, form one or more TRS lessees to lease 'qualified health care properties' from us. Any TRS lessee we may form will be subject to U.S. federal and state income tax on its taxable income, which will consist of the revenues from the qualified healthcare facilities leased by the TRS lessee, net of the operating expenses for such healthcare facilities and rent payments to us. In addition, if a TRS borrows funds either from us or a third party, it may be unable to deduct all or a portion of the interest paid, resulting in a higher corporate-level tax liability. Specifically, the Code imposes a disallowance of deductions for business interest expense (even if paid to third parties) in excess of the sum of a taxpayer's business interest income and 30% of the adjusted taxable income of the business, which is its taxable income computed without regard to business interest income or expense, net operating losses or the pass-through income deduction. Accordingly, although our ownership of a TRS lessee would allow us to participate in the operating income from our healthcare facilities leased to the TRS lessee on an after-tax basis in addition to receiving rent, that operating income would be fully subject to U.S. federal and state income tax, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations, ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## If leases of our healthcare facilities are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT and would be subject to higher taxes and have less cash available for distribution to our stockholders.

To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income tests, under which specified percentages of our gross income must be derived from certain sources, such as 'rents from real property.' Rents paid to our Operating Partnership by third-party lessees and any TRS lessee that we may form in the future pursuant to the leases of our healthcare facilities will constitute substantially all of our gross income. For such rent to qualify as 'rents from real property' for purposes of the gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes and not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement. If our leases are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations, ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Table of Contents

If a TRS lessee failed to qualify as a TRS or the facility operators engaged by a TRS lessee did not qualify as 'eligible independent contractors,' we would fail to qualify as a REIT and would be subject to higher taxes and have less cash available for distribution to our stockholders.

Rent paid by a lessee that is a 'related party tenant' of ours will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs. We may, in the future, lease certain of our healthcare facilities that qualify as 'qualified health care properties' to a TRS lessee. So long as that TRS lessee qualifies as a TRS, it will not be treated as a 'related party tenant' with respect to our healthcare facilities that are managed by an independent facility operator that qualifies as an 'eligible independent contractor.' We would seek to structure any future arrangements with a TRS lessee such that the TRS lessee would qualify to be treated as a TRS for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but there can be no assurance that the IRS would not challenge the status of a TRS for U.S. federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in disqualifying a TRS lessee from treatment as a TRS, it is possible that we would fail to meet the asset tests applicable to REITs and a significant portion of our income would fail to qualify for the gross income tests. If we failed to meet either the asset or gross income tests, we would likely lose our REIT qualification for U.S. federal  income  tax  purposes,  which,  in  turn,  could  materially  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations,  ability  to  make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

Additionally, if the facility operators engaged by a TRS lessee do not qualify as 'eligible independent contractors,' we would fail to qualify as a REIT. Each of the facility operators that would enter into a management contract with any TRS lessee must qualify as an 'eligible independent contractor' under the REIT rules in order for the rent paid to us by such a TRS lessee to be qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. Among other  requirements,  to  qualify  as  an  'eligible  independent  contractor,'  a  facility  operator  must  not  own,  directly  or  indirectly,  more  than  35%  of  our outstanding shares and no person or group of persons can own more than 35% of our outstanding shares and the ownership interests of the facility operator, taking  into  account  certain  ownership  attribution  rules.  The  ownership  attribution  rules  that  apply  for  purposes  of  these  35%  thresholds  are  complex. Although we would monitor ownership of our shares of common stock by any facility operators and their owners, there can be no assurance that these ownership levels will not be exceeded.

## You may be restricted from acquiring or transferring certain amounts of our common stock.

The stock ownership restrictions for REITs in the Code and the 9.8% share ownership limit in our charter may inhibit market activity in our capital stock and restrict our business combination opportunities.

In order to qualify as a REIT for each taxable year, five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Code, may not own, beneficially or constructively, more than 50% in value of our issued and outstanding shares of capital stock at any time during the last half of a taxable year. Attribution rules in the Code determine  if  any  individual  or  entity  beneficially  or  constructively  owns  our  shares  of  capital  stock  under  this  requirement. Additionally,  at  least  100 persons must beneficially own our shares of capital stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year for each taxable year. To help ensure that we meet these tests, our charter restricts the acquisition and ownership of shares of our capital stock.

Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT. Unless exempted by the Board, our charter prohibits any person from beneficially or constructively owning more than 9.8% in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our shares of capital stock. The Board may not grant an exemption from this restriction to any proposed transferee whose ownership in excess of 9.8% of the value of our outstanding shares would result in our failing to qualify as a REIT.

## Table of Contents

## Dividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.

The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to 'qualified dividend income' payable to U.S. stockholders that are taxed at individual rates  is  20%  (plus  the  3.8%  surtax  on  net  investment  income,  if  applicable).  Dividends  payable  by  REITs,  however,  generally  are  not  eligible  for  the reduced rates on qualified dividend income. Rather, ordinary REIT dividends constitute 'qualified business income' and thus a 20% deduction is available to individual taxpayers with respect to such dividends, resulting in a 29.6% maximum U.S. federal income tax rate (plus the 3.8% surtax on net investment income, if applicable) for individual U.S. stockholders. To qualify for this deduction, the stockholder receiving such dividends must hold the dividendpaying REIT stock for at least 46 days (taking into account certain special holding period rules) of the 91-day period beginning 45 days before the stock became ex-dividend and cannot be under an obligation to make related payments with respect to a position in substantially similar or related property. Without further legislative action, the 20% deduction applicable to ordinary REIT dividends will expire on January 1, 2026. The more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are taxed at individual rates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stock of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including our common and preferred stock.

## We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes.

At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws or regulations governing REITs, or the administrative interpretations of those laws or regulations, may be amended. We cannot predict when or if any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, regulation, or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated, or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. We and our stockholders could be adversely affected by any such change in the U.S. federal income tax laws, regulations, or administrative interpretations which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operation, ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## If our Operating Partnership failed to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.

We believe that our Operating Partnership will be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, our Operating Partnership will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, will be allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, its share of our Operating Partnership's income. We cannot assure you, however, that the IRS will not challenge the status of our Operating Partnership or any other subsidiary partnership in which we own an interest as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating our Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary partnership as an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs and, accordingly, we would likely cease to qualify as a REIT. Also, the failure of our Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships to qualify as  a  partnership  could  cause  it  to  become  subject  to  U.S.  federal  and  state  corporate  income  tax,  which,  in  turn,  could  materially  adversely  affect  our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.

## Tax  protection  agreements  may  limit  our  ability  to  sell  or  otherwise  dispose  of  certain  properties  and  may  require  our  Operating  Partnership  to maintain certain debt levels that otherwise would not be required to operate our business.

In connection with contributions of properties to our Operating Partnership, our Operating Partnership has entered and may in the future enter into tax protection agreements under which it agrees to minimize the tax consequences to the contributing partners resulting from the sale or other disposition of the contributed properties. Tax protection agreements may make it economically prohibitive to sell any properties that are subject to such agreements even though it may otherwise be in our stockholders' best interests to do so. In addition, we may be required to maintain a minimum level of indebtedness throughout the term of any tax protection agreement regardless of whether such debt levels are otherwise required to operate our business. Nevertheless, we have entered and may in the future enter into tax protection agreements to assist contributors of properties to our Operating Partnership in deferring the recognition of taxable gain because of and after any such contribution.

## Overview

Global Medical REIT Inc. (the 'Company,' 'us,' 'we,' or 'our') is an internally managed REIT that acquires healthcare facilities and leases those  facilities  to  physician  groups  and  regional  and  national  healthcare  systems.  We  conduct  our  business  through  an  umbrella  partnership  REIT,  or UPREIT,  structure  in  which  our  properties  are  owned  by  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  of  our  operating  partnership,  Global  Medical  REIT  L.P.  (the 'Operating Partnership'). Our wholly owned subsidiary, Global Medical REIT GP LLC, is the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership and, as of December  31,  2022,  we  owned  93.97%  of  the  outstanding  common  operating  partnership  units  ('OP  Units')  of  our  Operating  Partnership,  with  an aggregate of 6.03% of the Operating Partnership owned by holders of long-term incentive plan units ('LTIP Units') and third-party limited partners who contributed properties or services to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units.

Our revenues are derived from the rental and operating expense reimbursement payments we receive from our tenants, and most of our leases are medium  to  long-term  triple  net  leases  with  contractual  rent  escalation  provisions.    Our  primary  expenses  are  depreciation,  interest,  and  general  and administrative expenses.  We finance our acquisitions with a mixture of debt and equity primarily from our cash from operations, borrowings off our Credit Facility, and stock issuances.

## Our Properties

## Completed Acquisitions

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we completed 14 acquisitions encompassing an aggregate of 583,253 leasable square feet for an aggregate contractual purchase price of $148.9 million with annualized base rent of $11.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio consisted of gross investment in real estate of $1.5 billion, which was comprised of 189 buildings with an aggregate of 4.9 million leasable square feet and $114.5 million of annualized base rent.

## Table of Contents

## Completed Property Dispositions

In July 2022, we sold a medical office building located in Germantown, Tennessee receiving gross proceeds of $17.9 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $6.8 million.

## Capital Raising Activity

During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  the  Company  generated  gross  proceeds  of  $10.3  million  through  at-the-market  ("ATM")  equity issuances of 0.6 million shares of the Company's common stock at an average offering price of $17.15 per share.

## Debt and Hedging Activity

On August 1, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility (the 'Amendment'), that, among other things, (i) added a new $150 million term loan, which matures on February 1, 2028 (the 'Term Loan B'), (ii) extended the maturity date of the Revolver from May 2025 to August 2026, and (iii) transitioned all LIBOR-based loans under the Credit Facility to SOFR-based loans. LIBOR-based interest rates on amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility were transitioned to a SOFR-based interest rate equal to term SOFR plus a related spread adjustment of 10 basis points and a borrowing spread based on the current pricing grid in the Credit Facility. We may be entitled to a temporary reduction in the interest rate of two basis points provided we meet certain to be agreed upon sustainability goals.

We have entered into interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate risk on the Term Loans through their respective maturities.  For additional information related to our interest rate swaps, see the 'Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing - Hedging Instruments' section herein.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we borrowed $138.6 million under our Credit Facility and repaid $15.5 million, for a net amount borrowed of $123.1 million. As of December 31, 2022, the net outstanding Credit Facility balance was $636.4 million and as of February 24, 2023, we had unutilized borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility of $245.0 million.

## Recent Developments

## Chapter 11 Reorganization Filing of Pipeline Health System, LLC

On October 3, 2022, Pipeline Health System, LLC ('Pipeline'), announced that it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code. At the time of its bankruptcy filing, Pipeline operated seven hospitals in three states, including the White Rock Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, an acute-care hospital owned by the Company where Pipeline is the sole tenant. According to the filed bankruptcy documents, although Pipeline has experienced the same labor and reimbursement pressures that many acute-care hospitals have been facing since the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic, the primary reason for the bankruptcy filing relates to Pipeline's facilities in Chicago, Illinois, and not the White Rock Medical Center. While in bankruptcy, Pipeline sold its facilities in Chicago, Illinois and on January 13, 2023, the bankruptcy court approved Pipeline's plan of reorganization (the 'Reorganization Plan').  As part of the Reorganization Plan, Pipeline agreed to assume our leases at White Rock Medical Center with certain amendments to  facilitate  its  emergence  from  bankruptcy  and  new  operating  plan. The  Reorganization  Plan  with  respect  to  the  Company's  leases  with  Pipeline  was effective as of February 6, 2023.

## Acquisition Under Contract

As of February 24, 2023, we had one acquisition under contract for a purchase price of approximately $6.7 million. We are currently in the due diligence period for our property under contract. If we identify problems with this property or the operator of this property during our due diligence review, we may not close the transaction on a timely basis or we may terminate the purchase agreement and not close the transaction.

## Table of Contents

## Properties Under Contract for Sale

As of February 24, 2023, we had two properties under contract for sale for aggregate gross sales proceeds of approximately $11.6 million and an aggregate net book value of $8.3 million. The transactions are expected to be completed by March 31, 2023. The buyers are currently in the due diligence periods and the transactions are subject to various closing contingencies. Accordingly, the transactions may not close on a timely basis or the buyers may terminate the purchase agreements and not close the transactions.

## Trends Which May Influence Our Results of Operations

We believe the following trends may positively impact our results of operations:

- ● An aging population . According to the 2020 U.S. Census, the nation's 65-and-older population has grown rapidly since 2010, driven by the aging of Baby Boomers born between 1946 and 1964. The 65-and-older population grew by over a third during the past decade, and by 3.2% from 2018 to 2019. We believe this segment of the U.S. population will utilize many of the services provided at our healthcare facilities such as orthopedics, cardiac, gastroenterology and rehabilitation.
- ● A  continuing  shift  towards  outpatient  care .  According  to  the  American  Hospital  Association,  patients  are  demanding  more  outpatient operations. We believe this shift in patient preference from inpatient to outpatient facilities will benefit our tenants as most of our properties consist of outpatient facilities.
- ● Physician practice group and hospital consolidation . We believe the trend towards physician group consolidation will serve to strengthen the credit quality of our tenants if our tenants merge or are consolidated with larger health systems.

We believe the following trends may negatively impact our results of operations:

- ● Increased interest rate and inflation environment and cost of capital . Due to a strong labor market and high inflation, the Fed has raised the Federal Funds Rate eight times since the beginning of  2022, bringing the current target rate to 4.50% to 4.75% and is expected to continue to increase the Federal Funds Rate during 2023. Additionally, the Fed has begun reducing the size of its balance sheet, which could also cause an  increase  in  interest  rates.  Due  to  this  interest  rate  environment,  term  SOFR,  which  is  the  reference  rate  for  our  floating  rate  debt,  is currently forecasted to increase to approximately 5.40% by August 2023 (based on the term SOFR forward curve as of February 24, 2023), or approximately  108  basis  points  (1.08%)  from  our  SOFR  rate  as  of  December  31,  2022.  Based  on  our  floating  rate  debt  balance  as  of December 31, 2022, a 100 basis point increase in term SOFR would have caused our annual interest expense to increase by approximately $1.5 million.
- The  rapid  increase  in  inflation  and  interest  rates  caused  the  common  stock  prices  of  many  REITs,  including  the  Company's,  to  fall significantly during 2022. Although the Company's stock price has been increasing in 2023 to date, it has not yet returned to a level that would cause the Company's cost of capital to return to levels seen in early 2022. This decrease in stock price and increase in interest rates has significantly  increased  the  Company's  cost  of  capital,  which,  in  turn,  has  significantly  reduced  its  ability  to  acquire  assets  that  meet  the Company's investment requirements.
- ● Continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic . The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the healthcare industry in many ways.  Many stories exist about U.S. healthcare workers, especially nurses, experiencing burnout due to the length and severity of the pandemic, and this has caused many  nurses  and  other  medical  professionals  to  switch  jobs  within  the  medical  profession  or  quit  their  professions  altogether.  This phenomenon has led to material increases in labor costs for healthcare systems, especially hospital systems, as some employers have had to rely on higher costing contract nursing labor to sustain their businesses. The increase in labor costs, among various other factors, contributed to the rapid increase in inflation during 2022. Furthermore, the continued spread of the BA.5 variant of COVID-19 (and its subvariants) in the U.S. has prolonged the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Table of Contents

- ● Changes in third party reimbursement methods and policies . The price of healthcare services has been increasing, and, as a result, we believe that third-party payors, such as Medicare and commercial insurance companies, will continue to scrutinize and reduce the types of healthcare services eligible for, and the amounts of, reimbursement under their health insurance plans. Additionally, many employer-based insurance plans  continue  to  increase  the  percentage  of  insurance  premiums  for  which  covered  individuals  are  responsible,  which  makes  healthcare services  more  expensive  for  individuals.  We  expect  these  trends  will  only  be  exacerbated  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  as  medical expenditures increased significantly during the pandemic. If these trends continue, our tenants' businesses will continue to be negatively affected, which may impact their ability to pay rent to us.

## Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time-to-time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.

For a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 - 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that it may require complex judgment in its application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.

We  consider  our  critical  accounting  estimates  to  be  those  used  in  the  determination  of  the  reported  amounts  and  disclosure  related  to  the following:

- ● Investment in Real Estate
- ● Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
- ● Revenue Recognition

## Investment in Real Estate

All of our facility acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were accounted for as asset acquisitions because substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets that we acquired were concentrated in a single asset or group of similar identifiable assets. Accordingly, the purchase prices of acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities were recorded and allocated at fair value on a relative basis. The recorded allocations are based  on  estimated  cash  flow  projections  of  the  properties  acquired  which  incorporates  discount,  capitalization  and  interest  rates  as  well  as  available comparable market information. We use considerable judgement in our estimates of cash flow projections, discount, capitalization and interest rates, fair market lease rates, carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, and costs to execute similar leases.

While our methodology for purchase price allocations did not change during the year ended December 31, 2022, the real estate market is fluid and our  assumptions  are  based  on  information  currently  available  in  the  market  at  the  time  of  acquisition.  Significant  increases  or  decreases  in  these  key estimates, particularly with regards to cash flow projections and discount and capitalization rates, would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value allocated to acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities.

In the case of the fair value of buildings and fair value of land and certain other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation or amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of  the  fair  value  of  above-market  or  below-market  lease  intangibles,  our  estimates  of  the  values  of  these  components  will  affect  the  amount  of  rental revenue we record as these values are amortized as a reduction of or an addition to rental income over the estimated remaining term of the respective leases.

## Table of Contents

## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review our real estate assets on an asset group basis for impairment. We identify an asset group based on the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. In the impairment analysis we must determine whether there are indicators of impairment. For operating properties, these indicators could include a reduction in our estimated hold period, a significant decline in a property's leasing percentage, a current period operating loss or negative cash flows combined with a history of losses at the property, a significant decline in lease rates for that property or others in the property's market, a significant change in the market value of the property, or an adverse change in the financial condition of significant tenants.

If  we determine that an asset has indicators of impairment, we must determine whether the undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset exceed the carrying amount of the asset. In calculating the undiscounted net cash flows of an asset, we use considerable judgement to estimate a number of inputs. We must estimate future rental rates, future capital expenditures, future operating expenses, and market capitalization rates for residual values, among other things. In addition, if there are alternative strategies for the future use of the asset, we assess the probability of each alternative strategy and perform a probability-weighted undiscounted cash flow analysis to assess the recoverability of the asset.

In determining the fair value of an asset, we exercise considerable judgment on a number of factors. We may determine fair value by using a discounted cash flow calculation or by utilizing comparable market information. We use judgement to determine an appropriate discount rate to apply to the cash flows in the discounted cash flow calculation. We also use judgment in analyzing comparable market information because no two real estate assets are identical in location and price.

The estimates and judgments used in the impairment process are highly subjective and susceptible to frequent change. Significant increases or decreases in any of these inputs, particularly with regards to cash flow projections and discount and capitalization rates, would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement of the real estate assets being assessed. Additionally, changes in economic and operating conditions, including changes in the financial condition of our tenants, and changes to our intent and ability to hold the related asset, that occur subsequent to our impairment assessment could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results.

## Revenue Recognition

Our  operations  primarily  consist  of  rental  revenue  earned  from  tenants  under  leasing  arrangements  which  provide  for  minimum  rent  and escalations. Management exercises considerable judgment in the rental property revenue recognition process including the treatment of the contractual rental stream and the determination of its collectability.

Our leases have been accounted for as operating leases. For operating leases with contingent rental escalators, revenue is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due during the period. Revenue from leases with fixed annual rental escalators are recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term, when we believe substantially all lease income, including the related straight-line receivable, is probable of collection.

We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators and exercise considerable judgement in assessing the probability of collection. Our assessment of collectability incorporates available operational performance measures such as sales and the aging of billed amounts as well as  other  publicly  available  information  with  respect  to  our  tenant's  financial  condition,  liquidity  and  capital  resources,  including  declines  in  such conditions. In the event that we determine receivables are not probable of collection, lease income will be recorded on a cash basis, with the corresponding tenant  receivable  and  straight-line  rent  receivable  charged  as  a  direct  write-off  against  rental  revenue  in  the  period  of  the  change  in  our  collectability determination. If management's assumptions regarding the collectability of lease related receivables prove incorrect, we could experience decreases in rental revenue, including decreases in excess of any amounts initially recognized.

## Consolidated Results of Operations

The major factors that resulted in variances in our results of operations for each revenue and expense category for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, were the increase in the size of our property portfolio and related increases in rental revenue and operating expenses, as well as depreciation and amortization expenses. Rising interest rates and increased interest expense on our indebtedness also had a significant impact on our 2022 results of operations. Our total investments in real estate, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

For a discussion related to our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, refer to  Part  II,  Item  7.  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  in  our Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on March 1, 2022.

## Revenue

## Total Revenue

Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $137.3 million, compared to $115.9 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of $21.4 million. The increase was primarily the result of rental revenue earned from the facilities we acquired during 2022, as well as from the recognition of a full year of rental revenue in 2022 from acquisitions that were completed during 2021. Within that increase, $18.7 million in revenue was recognized from net lease expense recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $11.6 million for the same period in 2021.

## Expenses

## General and Administrative

General  and  administrative  expenses  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022  and  2021  were  $16.5  million.  A  reduction  in  non-cash  LTIP compensation expense, which was $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $5.8 million for the same period in 2021, was offset by an increase in cash compensation costs and general corporate expenses.

## Table of Contents

## Operating Expenses

Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $25.2 million, compared with $15.5 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of $9.7 million. The increase results primarily from $18.7 million of recoverable property operating expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $11.6 million for the same period in 2021. In addition, our operating expenses included $4.7 million of non-recoverable property operating expenses from gross leases for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $2.3 million for the same period in 2021.

## Depreciation Expense

Depreciation  expense  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022  was  $40.0  million,  compared  to  $33.8  million  for  the  same  period  in  2021,  an increase of $6.2 million. The increase resulted primarily from depreciation expense incurred on the facilities we acquired during 2022, as well as from the recognition of a full year of depreciation expense in 2022 from acquisitions that were completed during 2021.

## Amortization Expense

Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $16.7 million, compared to $13.1 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of $3.6 million. The increase resulted primarily from amortization expense related to intangible assets connected to the facilities we acquired during 2022, as well as from the recognition of a full year of amortization expense in 2022 from acquisitions that were completed during 2021.

## Interest Expense

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $25.2 million, compared to $19.7 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of $5.5 million. This increase was due to higher average borrowings as well as increased interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021.

The weighted average interest rate of our debt for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 3.43% compared to 3.06% in 2021. Additionally, the weighted average interest rate and term of our debt was 4.20% and 3.93 years, respectively, at December 31, 2022.

## Income Before Gain on Sale of Investment Property

Income before gain on sale of investment property for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $13.2 million, compared to $17.3 million for the same period in 2021, a decrease of $4.1 million.

## Gain on Sale of Investment Property

In July 2022, we sold a medical office building located in Germantown, Tennessee receiving gross proceeds of $17.9 million, resulting in a gain of $6.8 million. In October 2021, we sold a medical office building located in Prescott, Arizona receiving gross proceeds of $5.5 million, resulting in a gain of $1.1 million.

## Net Income

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $20.0 million compared to $18.3 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of $1.7 million.

## Assets and Liabilities

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our principal assets consisted of investments in real estate, net, of $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. We completed 14 acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2022. Our liquid assets consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $14.5 million and $12.8 million, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

## Table of Contents

The increase in our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances to $14.5 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to $12.8 million as of December 31, 2021, was primarily due to borrowings on our Credit Facility, larger net proceeds received from the sale of an investment property during 2022, and net proceeds received from ATM equity issuances, partially offset by funds used to acquire real estate and pay dividends to our common and preferred stockholders and OP Unit and LTIP Unit holders of our Operating Partnership.

The  increase  in  our  total  liabilities  to  $744.2  million  as  of  December  31,  2022  compared  to  $625.9  million  as  of  December  31,  2021,  was primarily the result of higher net borrowings outstanding, partially offset by a decrease in the derivative liability balance.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

## General

Our short-term (up to 12 months) liquidity requirements include:

- ● Interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness;
- ● General and administrative expenses;
- ● Property operating expenses;
- ● Property acquisitions;
- ● Distributions on our common and preferred stockholders and OP Unit and LTIP Unit holders in our Operating Partnership; and
- ● Capital and tenant improvements.

In  2023,  we  are  contractually  obligated  to  pay,  or  have  capital  commitments  for,  approximately  (i)  $30.5  million  of  principal  and  interest payments on our outstanding debt, and (ii) $0.2 million in ground and operating lease expenses.  In addition, our preferred stock became redeemable by us in September 2022. The liquidation preference for our preferred stock is $77.6 million, and, if we decide to fully redeem, we will have to pay this amount plus fees and expenses.

Our  long-term  (beyond  12  months)  liquidity  requirements  consist  primarily  of  funds  necessary  to  pay  for  acquisitions,  capital  and  tenant improvements at our properties, scheduled debt maturities, general and administrative expenses, operating expenses, and distributions. Beyond 2023, we are contractually obligated to pay, or have capital commitments for, approximately (i) $788.9 million of principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt, and (ii) $13.0 million in ground and operating lease expenses.

We expect to satisfy our short and long-term liquidity needs through various internal and external sources, including cash flow from operations, debt financing, sales of additional equity securities, the issuance of OP Units in connection with acquisitions of additional properties, proceeds from select property dispositions and recapitalization transactions.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had aggregate capital improvement commitments and obligations to improve, expand, and maintain the Company's existing facilities of approximately $30 million. Many of these amounts are subject to contingencies that make it difficult to predict when they will be utilized, if at all. In accordance with the terms of the Company's existing and proposed leases, capital improvement obligations in the next 12 months are expected to total approximately $10 million.

## Internal Sources of Liquidity

Our primary internal sources of liquidity include cash flow from operations and proceeds from select property dispositions and recapitalization transactions.

## Table of Contents

## External Sources of Liquidity

Our primary external sources of liquidity include net proceeds received from equity issuances, including the issuance of OP Units in connection with acquisitions of additional properties, and debt financing, including borrowings under our Credit Facility and secured term loans.

## Equity Issuances

In  March  2022,  the  Company  and  the  Operating  Partnership  entered  into  a  Sales Agreement  with  certain  sales  agents,  pursuant  to  which  the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, up to $300 million of its common stock.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated gross proceeds of $10.3 million through equity issuances of 0.6 million shares of the Company's common stock at an average offering price of $17.15 per share. We did not issue any shares under our ATM program during the third or fourth quarters of 2022 or to date in 2023.

## Debt Financing .

Credit Facility. Our Credit Facility consists of (i) the $350 million Term Loan A, (ii) the $150 million Term Loan B, and (iii) the $400 million Revolver. The Credit Facility also contains a $500 million accordion feature. As of February 24, 2023, we had unutilized borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility of $245.0 million. As of August 1, 2022, LIBOR-based interest rates on amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility were transitioned to a SOFR-based interest rate equal to term SOFR plus a related spread adjustment of 10 basis points and a borrowing spread based on the current pricing grid in the Credit Facility.

The Credit Facility is an unsecured facility with a term of (i) four years (beginning on August 1, 2022) for the Revolver (subject to two, six-month extension options), (ii) five years for Term Loan A (beginning on its origination date of May 3, 2021), and (iii) five years and five months for Term Loan B.

We are subject to a number of financial covenants under the amended Credit Facility, including, among other things, the following as of the end of each fiscal quarter, (i) a maximum consolidated unsecured leverage ratio of less than 60%, (ii) a maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio of less than 30%, (iii)  a  maximum  consolidated  secured  recourse  leverage  ratio  of  less  than  10%,  (iv)  a  minimum  fixed  charge  coverage  ratio  of  1.50:1.00,  (v)  a minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio of 1.50:1.00, (vi) a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of less than 60%, and (vii) a minimum net worth of $573 million plus 75% of all net proceeds raised through equity offerings subsequent to March 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, management believed it complied with all of the financial and non-financial covenants contained in the Credit Facility.

Other Fixed Debt. We also have $58.1 million in gross notes payable as of December 31, 2022. This debt is comprised of four instruments.

Hedging Instruments. We have six interest rate swaps and nine forward-starting interest rate swaps that are used to manage our interest rate risk. A description of these swaps is below:

## Term Loan A Swaps

As of December 31, 2022, six of our interest rate swaps related to Term Loan A. The notional value of these swaps is $350 million, with $150 million of the swaps maturing in August 2023 and the remaining $200 million maturing in August 2024. In addition, we have five forward starting interest rate swaps that will be effective on the maturity dates of Term Loan A's existing interest rate swaps. These forward starting swaps each have a maturity date of April 2026. Currently, the Term Loan A swaps fix the SOFR component of Term Loan A at a rate of 1.80% through August 2023. Subsequently, from August 2023 to August 2024 the SOFR component of Term Loan A will be fixed at 1.50%. Finally, from August 2024 to April 2026 the SOFR component of Term Loan A will be fixed at 1.36%.

## Table of Contents

## Term Loan B Swaps

On August 2, 2022, we entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps related to Term Loan B with a notional value of $150 million that, beginning on October 1, 2022, fix the SOFR component on Term Loan B through January 2028 at 2.54%.

Total Fixed Debt . Our fixed debt totaled $558.1 million on a gross basis at December 31, 2022, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.75% based on our interest rate swaps and at current leverage. The weighted average maturity of our fixed debt was 3.8 years at December 31, 2022. Due to our forward swap structures, the weighted average interest rate on fixed debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022 is expected to improve over the next few years. Weighted average interest rates on the Company's fixed debt are expected to decrease to approximately 3.67% in 2023, 3.50% in 2024, and 3.43% in 2025, based on the Company's current leverage.

## Cash Flow Information

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $76.5 million, compared with $69.0 million for the same period in 2021. The increase during the 2022 period was primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization expenses, partially offset by a larger gain from the sale of an investment property during 2022 and a decrease in non-cash LTIP compensation expense compared to the same period in 2021.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $137.3 million, compared with $194.7 million for the same period in 2021. The decrease during the 2022 period was primarily the result of less real estate investment activity compared to the same period in 2021, partially offset by larger net proceeds received from the sale of an investment property during 2022.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $62.4 million, compared with $127.7 million for the same period in 2021. The decrease during the 2022 period was primarily due to less proceeds received from equity offerings, partially offset by net borrowings on our Credit Facility in 2022 compared to net repayments in 2021.

## Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Management considers certain non-GAAP financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of the Company's operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure financial performance, financial position or cash flows, but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable measure determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company reports non-GAAP financial measures because these measures are observed by management to also be among the most predominant measures used by the REIT industry and by  industry  analysts  to  evaluate  REITs.  For  these  reasons,  management  deems  it  appropriate  to  disclose  and  discuss  these  non-GAAP  financial measures. Set forth below are descriptions of the non-GAAP financial measures management considers relevant to the Company's business and useful to investors, as well as reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

The non-GAAP financial measures presented herein are not necessarily identical to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income, as indicators of the Company's financial performance, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as measures of the Company's liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. Management believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the  Company's  historical  consolidated  operating  results,  these  measures  should  be  examined  in  conjunction  with  net  income  and  cash  flows  from operations as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations

Funds  from  operations  ('FFO')  and  adjusted  funds  from  operations  ('AFFO')  are  non-GAAP  financial  measures  within  the  meaning  of  the rules  of  the  SEC.  The  Company  considers  FFO  and AFFO  to  be  important  supplemental  measures  of  its  operating  performance  and  believes  FFO  is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results.

In accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' ('NAREIT') definition, FFO means net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP before noncontrolling interests of holders of OP Units and LTIP Units, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property and extraordinary items, less preferred stock dividends, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of debt issuance costs and the amortization of above and below market leases), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Because FFO excludes real estate-related depreciation and amortization (other than amortization of debt issuance costs and above and below market lease amortization expense), the Company believes that FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared period-over-period, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from the closest GAAP measurement, net income or loss.

AFFO is a non-GAAP measure used by many investors and analysts to measure a real estate company's operating performance by removing the effect of items that do not reflect ongoing property operations. Management calculates AFFO by modifying the NAREIT computation of FFO by adjusting it  for  certain  cash  and  non-cash  items  and  certain  recurring  and  non-recurring  items.  For  the  Company  these  items  include  recurring  acquisition  and disposition costs, loss on the extinguishment of debt, recurring straight line deferred rental revenue, recurring stock-based compensation expense, recurring amortization of above and below market leases, recurring amortization of debt issuance costs, recurring lease commissions, management internalization costs, and other items.

Management believes  that  reporting AFFO  in  addition  to  FFO  is  a  useful  supplemental  measure  for  the  investment  community  to  use  when evaluating the operating performance of the Company on a comparative basis.

A reconciliation of FFO and AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 is as follows:

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (EBITDAre) and Adjusted EBITDAre

The Company calculates EBITDA re in accordance with standards established by NAREIT and defines EBITDA re as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, gain or loss on the sale of investment properties, and impairment loss, as applicable. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA re as EBITDA re plus non-cash stock compensation expense, non-cash intangible amortization related to above and below market leases, preacquisition expense and other normalizing items. Management  considers EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA re important measures because they provide additional information to allow management, investors, and our current and potential creditors to evaluate and compare our core operating results and our ability to service debt.

A  reconciliation  of  net  income  (loss)  to  EBITDA re and Adjusted  EBITDA re for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2022,  2021,  and  2020  is  as follows:

## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business and investment objectives, we expect that the primary market risk to which we will be exposed is interest rate risk.

We may be exposed to the effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of debt used to acquire healthcare facilities, including borrowings under the Credit Facility. The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the value of our variable rate financial obligations to selected changes in market interest rates. The range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period.

As of December 31, 2022, we had $145.7 million of unhedged borrowings outstanding under the Revolver (before the netting of unamortized debt issuance  costs)  that  bears  interest  at  a  variable  rate.  See  'Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operation  Liquidity and Capital Resources' for a detailed discussion of our Credit Facility. At December 31, 2022, SOFR on our outstanding floating-rate borrowings was 4.32%. Assuming no increase in the amount of our variable interest rate debt, if SOFR increased 100 basis points, our cash flow would decrease by approximately $1.5 million annually. Assuming no increase in the amount of our variable rate debt, if SOFR were reduced 100 basis points, our cash flow would increase by approximately $1.5 million annually.

## Table of Contents

As of December 31, 2021, our exposure to interest rate risk was not materially different from our exposure as of December 31, 2022.

Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we may borrow at fixed rates or floating rates. See ' Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Hedging Instruments ,' for a description of our interest rate swaps.

We may enter into additional derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and caps, in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on our future borrowings. We will not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.

In addition to changes in interest rates, the value of our investments is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of tenants/operators and borrowers, which may affect our ability to refinance our debt if necessary.

## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Global Medical REIT Inc.

## Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Medical REIT Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 1, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

## Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

## Acquisition of Real Estate Assets - Refer to Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements

## Critical Audit Matter Description

During the year-ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed 14 property acquisitions which increased the Investment in Real Estate balance by approximately $148.9 million. For each acquisition, substantially all of the fair value was concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets and, therefore, each acquisition represents an asset acquisition. For asset acquisitions in the current year, the Company allocated the purchase price to tangible assets and any intangible assets acquired or liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values utilizing the assistance of a third-party appraiser. For these type of asset acquisitions, tangible assets include land, building, site improvement and tenant improvements. Intangible assets include in-place leases, leasing costs and above-market leases while intangible liabilities include below-market leases.

## Table of Contents

The fair value of land is determined using the sales comparison approach whereby recent comparable land sales and listings are gathered and summarized. The available market data is then compared to the land being valued and adjustments are made for dissimilar characteristics such as market conditions, size, and location. The fair value of buildings acquired are estimated on an as-if-vacant basis and the value is primarily based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates as well as available market information. The fair value of site improvements is based on the cost approach with a deduction for depreciation and the fair value of tenant improvements are based on prevailing market tenant improvement allowances.

In-place lease intangible assets are valued considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases in arriving at an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease-up period from vacant to existing occupancy. Estimates used in developing the carrying cost are based on market lease terms and include costs related to real estate taxes, insurance, and other operating expenses, as well as estimates of lost market rental revenue during the expected lease up periods. Leasing Cost intangible assets consist of leasing commissions and legal fees. Leasing commissions are estimated by multiplying the remaining contract rent by a market leasing commission. Legal fees represent legal costs associated with writing, reviewing, and sometimes negotiating various lease terms. The fair value of above-or-below market leases is estimated based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the lease acquired) of the difference between contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease and management's estimate of market lease rates measured over a period equal to the estimated remaining term of the lease.

Given the relative fair value determination of assets acquired and liabilities assumed required management to use various valuation methodologies and make significant estimates related to assumptions including the selection of the discount rates, capitalization rates, determination of market rental rates, tenant improvement allowance, expected lease up period, and comparable land sales adjusted for dissimilar characteristics, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the approach and these assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgement and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.

## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the acquisition of real estate assets included the following, among others:

- ● We tested the effectiveness of controls over the purchase price allocation, including management's controls over the review of third-party appraisals, review of assumptions such as discount rates, capitalization rates, market rental rates, tenant improvement allowance, lease up period, comparable adjusted land sales, and the valuation methodologies for estimating the relative fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
- ● With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodologies, as well as various assumptions such as discount rates, capitalization rates, market rental rates, tenant improvement allowance, lease up period, and comparable adjusted land sales. For the discount rate, capitalization rate, tenant improvement allowance, and lease-up period assumptions, we developed an independent range and compared the rate or period selected by management to the range, considering property specific factors. For assumptions related to market rental rates, and comparable adjusted land sales, we evaluated the market comparables selected by management, concluding whether they were reasonable based on property specific factors.
- ● We tested the mathematical accuracy of the valuation models.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

## Note 1 - Organization

As  of  December  31,  2022,  the  Company  was  the  93.97%  limited  partner  of  the  Operating Partnership, with an aggregate of 6.03% of the Operating Partnership owned by holders of long-term incentive plan units ('LTIP Units') and third-party limited partners who contributed properties or services to the Operating Partnership in exchange for common limited partnership units ('OP Units'). The Company's common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol 'GMRE.' The Company's Series A Preferred Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "GMRE PrA."

## Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  the  Company  and  its  wholly  owned  subsidiaries. The  Company presents the portion of any equity it does not own but controls (and thus consolidates) as noncontrolling interest. Noncontrolling interest in the Company includes the LTIP Units that have been granted to directors, officers and affiliates of the Company and the OP Units held by third parties. Refer to Note 5 'Equity' and Note 7 - 'Stock-Based Compensation' for additional information regarding the OP Units and LTIP Units.

The Company classifies noncontrolling interest as a component of consolidated equity on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, separate from the Company's total equity. The Company's net income or loss is allocated to noncontrolling interests based on the respective ownership or voting percentage in  the  Operating  Partnership  associated  with  such  noncontrolling  interests  and  is  removed  from  consolidated  income  or  loss  on  the  Consolidated Statements of Operations in order to derive net income or loss attributable to common stockholders. The noncontrolling ownership percentage is calculated by dividing the aggregate number of LTIP Units and OP Units by the total number of units and shares outstanding. Any future issuances of additional LTIP Units or OP Units would change the noncontrolling ownership interest.

## Use of Estimates

The  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of America ('GAAP') requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

## Investment in Real Estate

The Company determines when an acquisition meets the definition of a business or alternatively should be accounted for as an asset acquisition in accordance  with  Accounting  Standard  Codification  ("ASC")  Topic  805  "Business  Combinations"  ("ASC  Topic  805"),  which  requires  that,  when substantially all of the fair value of an acquisition is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the asset or group of similar identifiable assets does not meet the definition of a business and therefore is required to be accounted for as an asset acquisition. Transaction costs are capitalized for asset acquisitions and expensed as incurred for business combinations. All of the Company's facility acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were accounted for as asset acquisitions because substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets the Company acquired were concentrated in a single asset or group of similar identifiable assets.

## Table of Contents

For asset acquisitions that are 'owner occupied' (meaning that the seller either is the tenant or controls the tenant), the purchase price, including capitalized  acquisition  costs,  will  be  allocated  to  land  and  building  based  on  their  relative  fair  values  with  no  value  allocated  to  intangible  assets  or liabilities. For asset acquisitions where there is a lease in place but not 'owner occupied,' the Company will allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and any intangible assets acquired or liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. Fair value is determined based upon the guidance of ASC Topic 820, 'Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,' and generally are determined using Level 2 inputs, such as rent comparables, sales comparables, and broker  indications.  Although  Level  3  Inputs  are  utilized,  they  are  minor  in  comparison  to  the  Level  2  data  used  for  the  primary  assumptions.  The determination of fair value involves the use of significant judgment and estimates. We make estimates to determine the fair value of the tangible and intangible  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  using  information  obtained  from  multiple  sources,  including  pre-acquisition  due  diligence,  and  we routinely utilize the assistance of a third-party appraiser.

## Valuation of tangible assets:

The fair value of land is determined using the sales comparison approach whereby recent comparable land sales and listings are gathered and summarized. The available market data is analyzed and compared to the land being valued and adjustments are made for dissimilar characteristics such as market conditions, size, and location. The Company estimates the fair value of buildings acquired on an as-if-vacant basis and depreciates the building value over its estimated remaining life. Fair value is primarily based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates as well as available market information. The Company determines the fair value of site improvements (non-building improvements that include paving and other) using the cost approach, with a deduction for depreciation, and depreciates the site improvements over their estimated remaining useful lives. Tenant improvements represent fixed improvements to tenant spaces, the fair value of which is estimated using prevailing market tenant improvement allowances. Tenant improvements are amortized over the remaining term of the lease.

## Valuation of intangible assets:

In determining the fair value of in-place leases (the avoided cost associated with existing in-place leases) management considers current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases in arriving at an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease-up period from vacant to existing occupancy. In estimating carrying costs, management includes reimbursable (based on market lease terms) real estate taxes, insurance, other operating expenses, as well as estimates of lost market rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods. The values assigned to in-place leases are amortized over the remaining term of the lease.

The fair value of above-or-below market leases is estimated based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflected the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the leases and management's estimate of market lease rates measured over a period equal to the estimated remaining term of the lease. An above market lease is classified as an intangible asset and a below market lease is classified as an intangible liability. The capitalized above-market or below-market lease intangibles are amortized as a reduction of, or an addition to, rental income over the estimated remaining term of the respective leases.

Intangible assets related to leasing costs consist of leasing commissions and legal fees. Leasing commissions are estimated by multiplying the remaining contract rent associated with each lease by a market leasing commission. Legal fees represent legal costs associated with writing, reviewing, and sometimes negotiating various lease terms. Leasing costs are amortized over the remaining useful life of the respective leases.

## Revenue Recognition

The Company's operations primarily consist of rental revenue earned from tenants under leasing arrangements which provide for minimum rent and escalations. The leases have been accounted for as operating leases. For operating leases with contingent rental escalators, revenue is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due during the period. Revenue from leases with fixed annual rental escalators are recognized on a straight-line basis  over  the  initial  lease  term,  subject  to  a  collectability  assessment,  with  the  difference  between  the  contractual  rental  receipts  and  the  straight-line amounts recorded as a 'deferred rent receivable.' Additionally, the Company recognizes as a component of rental revenue, 'expense recoveries' revenue, which  represents  revenue  recognized  related  to  tenant  reimbursement  of  real  estate  taxes,  insurance,  and  certain  other  operating  expenses  ('tenant reimbursements'). The Company recognizes these reimbursements and related expenses on a gross basis in its Consolidated Statements of Operations.

## Assets Held for Sale and Sales of Real Estate

The Company classifies a property as held for sale when the following criteria are met: (i) management, having the authority to approve action, commits to a plan to sell the property in its present condition, (ii) the sale of the property is at a price reasonable in relation to its current fair value and (iii) the sale is probable and expected to be completed within one year. At that time, the Company presents the assets and obligations associated with the real estate held for sale separately in its Consolidated Balance Sheets and ceases recording depreciation and amortization expense related to that asset.  Real estate held for sale is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. None of the Company's properties were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2022 or 2021.

Upon the  disposition  of  a  property,  the  Company  recognizes  a  gain  or  loss  at  a  point  in  time  when  the  Company  determines  control  of  the underlying asset has been transferred to the buyer. The Company's performance obligation is generally satisfied at the closing of the transaction. Any continuing involvement is analyzed as a separate performance obligation in the contract, and a portion of the sales price is allocated to each performance obligation. There is significant judgment applied to estimate the amount of variable consideration, if any, identified within the sales price and assess its probability of occurrence based on current market information, historical transactions, and forecasted information that is reasonably available.

For sales of real estate (or assets classified as held for sale), the Company evaluates whether the disposition is a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results, and, if so, it will be classified as discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates its real estate assets for impairment at each reporting date or whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an impairment indicator exists, the Company compares the expected future undiscounted cash flows against the carrying amount of the asset. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company would record an impairment loss for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset.

## Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

The Company considers all demand deposits, cashier's checks, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Amounts included in restricted cash represent (1) certain security deposits received from tenants at the inception of their leases;  (2)  cash  required  to  be  held  by  a  third-party  lender  as  a  reserve  for  debt  service;  and  (3)  funds  held  by  the  Company  related  to  tenant reimbursements. The following table provides a reconciliation of the Company's cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash that sums to the total of those amounts at the end of the periods presented on the Company's accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:

## Tenant Receivables, Net

The tenant receivable balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $8,040 and $6,070, respectively. The balance as of December 31, 2022 consisted of $1,348 in funds owed from the Company's tenants for rent that the Company had earned but had not yet received, $143 for a loan that was made to one of the Company's tenants, $5,520 of tenant reimbursements, and $1,029 of miscellaneous receivables. The balance as of December 31, 2021 consisted of $1,309 in funds owed from the Company's tenants for rent that the Company had earned but had not yet received, $1,158 of loans that were made to two of the Company's tenants, and $3,603 of tenant reimbursements.

## Table of Contents

Receivables arising  from  operating  leases  are  accounted  for  in  accordance  with ASC Topic  842  'Leases'  ('ASC Topic  842'). The  Company assesses  the  likelihood  of  losses  resulting  from  tenant  defaults,  or  the  inability  of  tenants  to  make  contractual  rent  and  tenant  reimbursements  at  each reporting date. The Company also monitors the liquidity and creditworthiness of its tenants and operators on a continuous basis. If the likelihood of a tenant paying its lease payments is determined to no longer be probable, all tenant receivables, including deferred rent, are written off against revenue and any future revenue for that tenant is recognized only upon receipt of cash. In addition, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had a portfolio level reserve of $350 on those leases that were probable of collection to ensure that the tenant lease receivables were not overstated.

## Escrow Deposits

The escrow balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $7,833 and $5,957, respectively. Escrow deposits include funds held in escrow to be used for the acquisition of properties in the future and for the payment of taxes, insurance, and other amounts as stipulated by the Company's Cantor Loan, as hereinafter defined.

## Deferred Assets

The deferred assets balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $29,616 and $25,417, respectively. The balance as of December 31, 2022 consisted of $29,467 in deferred rent receivables resulting from the recognition of revenue from leases with fixed annual rental escalations on a straightline basis and $149 of other deferred costs. The balance as of December 31, 2021 consisted of $25,356 in deferred rent receivables resulting from the recognition of revenue from leases with fixed annual rental escalations on a straight-line basis and $61 of other deferred costs.

## Other Assets

## Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders Per Share

The Company uses the treasury stock method to compute diluted net income or loss attributable to common stockholders per share. Basic net income or loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income or loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net income or loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income or loss attributable to common stockholders by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus any potential dilutive shares for the period. OP Units and LTIP Units are not reflected in the diluted per share calculation because the exchange of OP Units and LTIP Units into common stock is on a one-for-one basis, and both are allocated net income on a per share basis equal to the common stock. Accordingly, any exchange would not have any effect on diluted net income (loss) available to common stockholders per share. The Company considered the requirements of the twoclass method when computing earnings per share and determined that there would be no difference in its reported results if that method was utilized.

## Debt Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs include amounts paid to lenders and other third parties to obtain both fixed term and revolving debt and are amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the related debt. Refer to Note 4 - 'Credit Facility, Notes Payable and Derivative Instruments' for additional details.

## Related Party Disclosures

The  Company  enters  into  transactions  with  affiliated  entities,  or  'related  parties,'  which  are  recorded  as  receivables  or  payables  in  the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Related party disclosures are governed by ASC Topic 850, 'Related Party Disclosures.' Refer to Note 6 'Related Party Transactions' for additional information regarding the Company's related party transactions.

## Stock-Based Compensation

The Company grants LTIP Unit awards, including awards that vest over time and awards that vest based on achievement of specified performance criteria, to its employees and its independent directors. The Company accounts for all awards under ASC Topic 718, "Compensation-Stock Compensation." Refer to Note 7 - 'Stock Based Compensation' for additional details.

## Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Real estate and related assets are stated net of accumulated depreciation. Renovations, replacements and other expenditures that improve or extend the life of assets are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the buildings, which are generally between 20 and 52 years, tenant improvements, which are generally between one and 19 years, and site improvements, which are generally between three and 15 years. Values assigned to in-place lease and leasing costs intangible assets are charged as amortization expense using the straight-line method over the remaining term of the respective leases.

## Management Internalization Expense

Until  July  9,  2020,  the  Company  was  externally  managed  and  advised  by  its  former  advisor.  On  July  9,  2020,  the  Company  completed  its management internalization transaction, whereby the management agreement with the former advisor was terminated, the employees of the former advisor became employees of the Company and the functions previously performed by the former advisor were internalized by the Company. The total amount of consideration for the internalization transaction, after a working capital adjustment, was $17,746.

In accordance with ASC Topic 805, the portion of the consideration paid for the management internalization transaction that was attributed to the settlement of a preexisting contractual relationship (the management agreement) of $12,094 was recognized as 'Management Internalization Expense' in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the $5,903 of excess consideration paid over the fair value of underlying identifiable net liabilities of the business acquired of $251 was recorded as 'Goodwill' in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company also incurred $1,911 of expense related to the management internalization transaction for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is  also  included  in  the  'Management  Internalization  Expense'  line  item.  The  Company's  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  for  the  year  ended December 31, 2020, includes no revenue and $3,458 of net loss related to the operations of the business acquired subsequent to its acquisition.

The  accompanying  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2022  and  2021  include  the  operations  of  the business acquired for the full year. The table below presents the unaudited revenue and net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2020 on a pro forma basis as if the transaction occurred on January 1, 2020. The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred if the business combination had occurred on the first day of the period presented, nor does the pro forma information purport to represent the results of operations for future periods.

Cash paid for the acquisition of the former advisor, after consideration of the settlement of a preexisting contractual relationship of $12,094 and net of cash acquired of $559 was $5,093 and is included as an 'Investing' activity in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for year ended December 31, 2020.

## Goodwill

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's goodwill balance was $5,903. Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of underlying identifiable net assets of businesses acquired. The Company's goodwill balance was derived from the management internalization transaction. Goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company's policy is to perform its annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of the first day of the fourth quarter of its fiscal year. The Company has one reporting unit.

Goodwill  is  evaluated  for  impairment  either  under  a  qualitative  assessment  option  or  a  quantitative  approach  depending  on  the  facts  and circumstances of the reporting unit, consideration of the excess of the reporting unit's fair value over its carrying amount in previous assessments and changes in business environment.

When performing  a  qualitative  assessment,  the  Company  considers  factors  including,  but  not  limited  to,  current  macroeconomic  conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial performance and other events relevant to the entity or the reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed.

When performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test, the reporting unit carrying value is compared to its fair value. Goodwill is deemed impaired if, and the impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which, the reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value.

Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit requires the exercise of significant judgment and assumptions including judgments about expected future  cash  flows,  weighted-average  cost  of  capital,  discount  rates  and  expected  long-term  growth  rates. A  significant  change  to  these  estimates  and assumptions could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting unit to decline and increase the risk of an impairment charge to earnings.

The Company performed a qualitative analysis during the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year and determined that it was more likely than not that  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  was  in  excess  of  the  reporting  units  carrying  value,  and  as  a  result,  a  quantitative  step  one  analysis  was  not necessary.

## Income Taxes

The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2016. A REIT is generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes if it can meet many specific requirements. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to U.S. federal and state income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates, and the Company could not re-elect REIT status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which the failure occurred. Even if the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state or local income taxes, and the Company's TRS will be subject to U.S. federal, state, and local taxes on its income at regular corporate rates. The Company recognizes the tax effects of uncertain tax positions only if the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company has not identified any material uncertain tax positions and recognizes interest and penalties in income tax expense, if applicable. The Company is currently not under examination by any income tax jurisdiction.

## Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair value is a market-based measurement and should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are defined as follows:

- ● Level 1 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;
- ● Level 2 - Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; and
- ● Level 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.

The Company considers the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, escrow deposits, accounts and other receivables, and accounts payable and accrued expenses to approximate the fair value for these financial instruments because of the short period of time since origination or the short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are utilized to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. The Company considers the carrying value of its debt to approximate fair value. The fair values determined related to the Company's interest rate swap transactions utilize Level 2 inputs, since there is heavy reliance on a variety of inputs including contractual terms, interest rate curves, yield curves, measure of volatility, and correlations of such inputs. The fair values determined related to the Company's acquisitions of real estate where the identification and recording of intangible assets and liabilities is required primarily utilize Level 2 inputs since there is heavy reliance on market observable data such as rent comparables, sales comparables, and broker indications. Although some Level 3 inputs are utilized, they are minor in comparison to the Level 2 date used for the primary assumptions as it relates to acquisitions of real estate.

## Segment Reporting

ASC Topic 280, 'Segment Reporting,' establishes standards for reporting financial and descriptive information about a public entity's reportable segments.  The  Company  has  determined  that  it  has  one  reportable  segment,  with  activities  related  to  investing  in  medical  properties.  The  Company evaluates the operating performance of its investments on an individual asset level basis.

## Summary of Properties Acquired During the Year Ended December 31, 2022

During the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company completed 14 acquisitions. For each acquisition, substantially all of the fair value was concentrated  in  a  single  identifiable  asset  or  group  of  similar  identifiable  assets  and,  therefore,  each  acquisition  represents  an  asset  acquisition. Accordingly, transaction costs for these acquisitions were capitalized.

Depreciation expense was $40,008, $33,825, and $26,747 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had aggregate capital improvement commitments and obligations to improve, expand, and maintain the Company's existing facilities of approximately $30,088. Many of these amounts are subject to contingencies that make it difficult to predict when they will be utilized,  if  at  all.  In  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  Company's  existing  and  proposed  leases,  capital  improvement  obligations  in  the  next  twelve months are expected to total approximately $10,299.

## Note 4 - Credit Facility, Notes Payable and Derivative Instruments

## Credit Facility

The Company, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries (such subsidiaries, the 'Subsidiary Guarantors') are parties to an amended and restated $900 million unsecured syndicated credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ('JPMorgan'), as administrative agent (the 'Credit Facility'). The Credit Facility consists of (i) $500 million of term loans, which includes (a) a $350 million term loan ('Term Loan A') and (b) a $150 million term loan ('Term Loan B,' and, together with Term Loan A, the 'Term Loans'), and (ii) a $400 million revolver component (the 'Revolver'). The Credit Facility also includes a $500 million accordion feature. Term Loan A matures in May 2026, Term Loan B matures in February 2028, and the Revolver matures in August 2026, with two six-month extension options. As of August 1, 2022, LIBOR-based interest rates on amounts outstanding under the  Credit  Facility  were  transitioned  to  a  Secured  Overnight  Financing  Rate  ('SOFR')  based  interest  rate  equal  to  term  SOFR  plus  a  related  spread adjustment of 10 basis points and a borrowing spread based on the current pricing grid in the Credit Facility. The Company may be entitled to a temporary reduction in the interest rate of two basis points provided it meets certain to be agreed upon sustainability goals.

The Operating Partnership is subject to a number of financial covenants under the amended Credit Facility, including, among other things, the following as of the end of each fiscal quarter, (i) a maximum consolidated unsecured leverage ratio of less than 60%, (ii) a maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio of less than 30%, (iii) a maximum consolidated secured recourse leverage ratio of less than 10%, (iv) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of  1.50:1.00,  (v)  a  minimum  unsecured  interest  coverage  ratio  of  1.50:1.00,  (vi)  a  maximum  consolidated  leverage  ratio  of  less  than  60%,  and  (vii)  a minimum net worth of $573 million plus 75% of all net proceeds raised through equity offerings subsequent to March 31, 2022.

## Derivative Instruments - Interest Rate Swaps

The Company has six interest rate swaps and nine forward starting interest rate swaps that are used to manage its interest rate risk by fixing the SOFR component of the Term Loans through their maturities. A description of these swaps is below:

## Term Loan A Swaps

As of December 31, 2022, six of the Company's interest rate swaps related to Term Loan A. The notional value of these swaps is $350 million, with $150 million of the swaps maturing in August 2023 and the remaining $200 million maturing in August 2024. In addition, the Company has five forward starting interest rate swaps at notional amounts equal to the existing Term Loan A interest rate swaps that will be effective on the maturity dates of Term Loan A's existing interest rate swaps. These forward starting swaps each have a maturity date of April 2026. Currently, the Term Loan A swaps fix the SOFR component of Term Loan A at a rate of 1.80% through August 2023. Subsequently, from August 2023 to August 2024 the SOFR component of Term Loan A will be fixed at 1.50%. Finally, from August 2024 to April 2026 the SOFR component of Term Loan A will be fixed at 1.36%.

## Term Loan B Swaps

On August 2, 2022, the Company entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps related to Term Loan B with a notional value of $150 million that, beginning on October 1, 2022, fix the SOFR component on Term Loan B through January 2028 at 2.54%.

The Company records the swaps either as an asset or a liability measured at its fair value at each reporting period. When hedge accounting is applied, the change in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is (i) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the equity section of the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and (ii) subsequently reclassified into earnings as interest expense for the period that the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings. If specific hedge accounting criteria are not met, changes in the Company's derivative instruments' fair value are recognized currently as an adjustment to net income.

The Company's interest rate swaps are not traded on an exchange. The Company's interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value based on a variety of observable inputs including contractual terms, interest rate curves, yield curves, measure of volatility, and correlations of such inputs. The Company measures its derivatives at fair value on a recurring basis based on the expected size of future cash flows on a discounted basis and incorporating a measure of non-performance risk. The fair values are based on Level 2 inputs within the framework of ASC Topic 820. The Company considers its own credit risk, as well as the credit risk of its counterparties, when evaluating the fair value of its derivative instruments.

The fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps was an asset of $34,705 and a net liability of $6,554 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The  gross  balances  are  included  in  the  'Derivative Asset'  and  'Derivative  Liability'  line  items  on  the  Company's  Consolidated  Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The  table  below  details  the  components  of  the  amounts  presented  on  the  accompanying  Consolidated  Statements  of  Comprehensive  Income (Loss) recognized on the Company's interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.

## Note 7 - Stock-Based Compensation

## 2016 Equity Incentive Plan

The 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the 'Plan'), is intended to assist the Company and its affiliates in recruiting and retaining employees of the Company, members of the Board, executive officers of the Company, and individuals who provide services to the Company and its affiliates.

The Plan is intended to permit the grant of both qualified and non-qualified options and the grant of stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, unrestricted  stock,  awards  of  restricted  stock  units,  performance  awards  and  other  equity-based  awards  (including  LTIP  Units).  Based  on  the  grants outstanding as of December 31, 2022, there were 1,108 shares of common stock that remain available to be granted under the Plan. Units subject to awards under  the  Plan  that  are  forfeited,  cancelled,  lapsed,  or  otherwise  expired  (excluding  shares  withheld  to  satisfy  exercise  prices  or  tax  withholding obligations) are available for grant.

## Time-Based Grants

During the year ended December 31, 2022, pursuant to the recommendation of the Compensation Committee of the Board (the 'Compensation Committee'), the Board approved the following LTIP Unit activity:

| Total target performance awards as of December 31, 2022 |  331 |

Annual  Awards . The  Annual  Awards  are  subject  to  the  terms  and  conditions  of  LTIP  Annual  Award  Agreements  ('LTIP  Annual  Award Agreements') between the Company and each grantee.

The Compensation Committee and Board established performance goals for the year ending December 31, 2022, as set forth in the 2022 LTIP Annual Award Agreements (the 'Performance Goals') that will be used to determine the number of LTIP Units earned by each grantee. As of December 31,  2022,  management  estimated  that  the  Performance  Goals  would  be  met  at  an  85%  level  and,  accordingly,  cumulative  stock-based  compensation expense  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022  reflects  management's  estimate  that  85%  of  these  awards  will  be  earned. As  soon  as  reasonably practicable following the first anniversary of the Annual Awards grant date, the Compensation Committee and Board will determine the extent to which the Company has achieved each of the Performance Goals (expressed as a percentage) and, based on such determination, will calculate the number of LTIP Units that each grantee is entitled to receive. Each grantee may earn up to 150% of the number of his/her target LTIP Units. Any 2022 Annual Award LTIP Units that are not earned will be forfeited and cancelled.

Vesting. LTIP Units that are earned as of the end of the applicable performance period will vest in two installments as follows: 50% of the earned LTIP Units will become vested on February 28, 2023 (the end of the performance period) and 50% of the earned LTIP Units become vested on February 28,  2024,  the  one  year  anniversary  of  the  initial  vesting  date.  Vesting  may  be  accelerated  under  certain  circumstances  such  as  a  'change-in-control' transaction or a 'qualified termination' event.

Distributions. Distributions equal to the dividends declared and paid by the Company will accrue during the applicable performance period on the maximum number of LTIP Units that the grantee could earn and will be paid with respect to all of the earned LTIP Units at the conclusion of the applicable performance period, in cash or by the issuance of additional LTIP Units at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.

Long-Term  Awards. The  Long-Term  Awards  are  subject  to  the  terms  and  conditions  of  their  related  LTIP  Long-Term  Award  Agreements (collectively the 'LTIP Long-Term Award Agreements') between the Company and each grantee. The number of LTIP Units that each grantee earns under the LTIP Long-Term Award Agreements will be determined following the conclusion of a three-year performance period based on the Company's total stockholder return ('TSR'), which is determined based on a combination of appreciation in stock price and dividends paid during the performance period. Each grantee may earn up to 200% of the number of target LTIP Units covered by the grantee's Long-Term Award. Any target LTIP Units that are not earned  will  be  forfeited  and  cancelled.  The  number  of  LTIP  Units  earned  under  the  Long-Term  Awards  will  be  determined  as  soon  as  reasonably practicable following the end of the applicable three-year performance period based on the Company's TSR on an absolute basis (as to 75% of the LongTerm Award) and relative to the companies that comprised the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Health Care Index (the 'Index') (as to 25% of the Long-Term Award).

Vesting. LTIP Units that are earned as of the end of the applicable three-year performance period will vest in two installments as follows; 50% of the earned LTIP Units will vest upon the day prior to the third anniversary of the respective grant dates and the remaining 50% will vest on the one year anniversary of the initial vesting date. Vesting may be accelerated under certain circumstances such as a 'change-in-control' transaction or a 'qualified termination' event.

Distributions. Pursuant to the LTIP Long-Term Award Agreements, distributions equal to the dividends declared and paid by the Company will accrue during the applicable performance period on the maximum number of LTIP Units that the grantee could earn and will be paid with respect to all of the earned LTIP Units at the conclusion of the applicable performance period, in cash or by the issuance of additional LTIP Units at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.

## Stock-Based Compensation Expense

The Company's prospective compensation expense for all unvested LTIP Units, Annual Awards, and Long-Term Awards is recognized using the adoption date fair value of the awards, with no remeasurement required. Compensation expense for future LTIP Unit grants, Annual Awards, and LongTerm Awards is based on the grant date fair value of the units/awards, with no subsequent remeasurement required.

As the Long-Term Awards involve market-based performance conditions, the Company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation to provide a grant date fair value for expense recognition. The Monte Carlo simulation is a generally accepted statistical technique used, in this instance, to simulate a range of possible  future  stock  prices  for  the  Company  and  the  members  of  the  Index  over  the  Performance  Periods.  The  purpose  of  this  modeling  is  to  use  a probabilistic approach for estimating the fair value of the performance share award.

The assumptions used in  the  Monte  Carlo  simulation  include  beginning  average  stock  price,  valuation  date  stock  price,  expected  volatilities, correlation coefficients, risk-free rate of interest, and expected dividend yield. The beginning average stock price is the beginning average stock price for the Company and each member of the Index for the 15 trading days leading up to the grant date of the Long-Term Award. The valuation date stock price is the closing stock price of the Company and each of the peer companies in the Index on the grant dates of the Long-Term Awards. The expected volatilities are modeled using the historical volatilities for the Company and the members of the Index. The correlation coefficients are calculated using the same data as  the  historical  volatilities.  The  risk-free  rate  of  interest  is  taken  from  the  U.S.  Treasury  website  and  relates  to  the  expected  life  of  the  remaining performance period on valuation or revaluation. Lastly, the dividend yield assumption is 0.0%, which is mathematically equivalent to reinvesting dividends in the issuing entity, which is part of the Company's award agreement assumptions.

Below are details regarding certain of the assumptions for the Long-Term Awards using Monte Carlo simulations:

The Company incurred stock compensation expense of $4,681, $5,810, and $5,319, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively,  related  to  the  grants  awarded  under  the  Plan.  Compensation  expense  is  included  within  'General  and  Administrative'  expense  in  the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.

As  of  December  31,  2022,  total  unamortized  compensation  expense  related  to  these  awards  of  approximately  $4.5  million  is  expected  to  be recognized over a weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years.

## Note 8 - Leases

The Company operates as both a lessor and a lessee. As a lessor, the Company is required under ASC Topic 842 to account for leases using an approach that is substantially similar to ASC Topic 840's guidance for operating leases and other leases such as sales-type leases and direct financing leases. In addition, ASC Topic 842 requires lessors to capitalize and amortize only incremental direct leasing costs. As a lessee, the Company is required under the new standard to apply a dual approach, classifying leases, such as ground leases, as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase. This classification determines whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. ASC Topic 842 also requires lessees to record a right of use asset and a lease liability for all leases with an initial term of greater than a year regardless of their classification. The Company has also elected the practical expedient not to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of a year or less.

## Information as Lessor

To generate positive cash flow, as a lessor, the Company leases its facilities to tenants in exchange for fixed monthly payments that cover rent, property  taxes,  insurance  and  certain  cost  recoveries,  primarily  common  area  maintenance  ('CAM').  The  Company's  leases  were  determined  to  be operating  leases  and  have  a  portfolio-average-lease-years  remaining  of  approximately  10  years.  Payments  from  the  Company's  tenants  for  CAM  are considered nonlease components that are separated from lease components and are generally accounted for in accordance with the revenue recognition standard. However, the Company qualified for and elected the practical expedient related to combining the components because the lease component is classified as an operating lease and the timing and pattern of transfer of CAM income, which is not the predominant component, is the same as the lease component,  for  all  asset  classes.  As  such,  consideration  for  CAM  is  accounted  for  as  part  of  the  overall  consideration  in  the  lease.  Payments  from customers for property taxes and insurance are considered non-components of the lease and therefore no consideration is allocated to them because they do not transfer a good or service to the customer. Fixed contractual payments from the Company's leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. This means that, with respect to a particular lease, actual amounts billed in accordance with the lease during any given period may be higher or lower than the amount of rental revenue recognized for the period. Straight-line rental revenue is commenced when the tenant assumes control of the leased premises. Accrued straight-line rents receivable represents the amount by which straight-line rental revenue exceeds rents currently billed in accordance with lease agreements.

Some of the Company's leases are subject to annual changes in the Consumer Price Index ('CPI'). Although increases in CPI are not estimated as part of the Company's measurement of straight-line rental revenue, for leases with base rent increases based on CPI, the amount of rent revenue recognized is adjusted in the period the changes in CPI are measured and effective. Additionally, some of the Company's leases have extension options.

Initial direct costs, primarily commissions, related to the leasing of our facilities are capitalized when material as incurred. Capitalized leasing costs  are  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  remaining  useful  life  of  the  respective  leases. All  other  costs  to  negotiate  or  arrange  a  lease  are expensed as incurred.

Lease-related receivables, which include accounts receivable and accrued straight-line rents receivable, are reduced for credit losses, if applicable. The  Company  regularly  evaluates  the  collectability  of  its  lease-related  receivables.  The  Company's  evaluation  of  collectability  primarily  consists  of reviewing past due account balances and considering such factors as the credit quality of our tenant, historical trends of the tenant and changes in tenant payment terms. If the Company's assumptions regarding the collectability of lease-related  receivables  prove  incorrect,  the  Company  could  experience credit losses in excess of what was recognized in rental and other revenues.

The Company recognized $137,167 and $115,804 of rental revenue related to operating lease payments for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of these amounts $7,767 and $6,674, respectively, relate to variable rental revenue.

The aggregate annual cash to be received by the Company on the noncancelable operating leases related to its portfolio as of December 31, 2022 is as follows for the subsequent years ended December 31:

## Information as Lessee

The Company has seven buildings located on land that is subject to operating ground leases with a weighted average remaining term of approximately 43 years.  Rental  payments  on  these  leases  are  adjusted  periodically  based  on  either  the  CPI  or  on  a  pre-determined  schedule.  The  monthly  payments  on  a  predetermined schedule are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. Changes in the CPI are not estimated as part of our measurement of straight-line rental expense. The Company used a weighted average discount rate of approximately 7.5%, which was derived, using a portfolio approach, from our assessment of the credit quality of the Company and adjusted to reflect secured borrowing, estimated yield curves and long-term spread adjustments over appropriate tenors. Some of the Company's ground leases contain extension options and, where we determined it was reasonably certain that an extension would occur, they were included in our calculation of the right of use asset and liability. The Company recognized approximately $154 and $166 of ground lease expense, of which $154 and $122 was paid in cash, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The following table sets forth the undiscounted cash flows of our scheduled obligations for future lease payments on operating ground leases at December 31, 2022 and a reconciliation of those cash flows to the operating lease liability at December 31, 2022:

| 2023            | $ 206   |

| Total           | 6,738   |
| Discount        | (3,816) |
| Lease liability | $ 2,922 |

## Tenant Concentration

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company's rental revenues were derived from 266 tenants leasing 118 facilities.  During this period there were no tenants with rental revenue that exceeded 10% of the Company's rental revenue.

## Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies

## Litigation

The Company is not presently subject to any material litigation nor, to its knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against the Company, which if determined unfavorably to the Company, would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

## Environmental Matters

The Company follows a policy of monitoring its properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. While there can be no assurance that a material environmental liability does not exist at its properties, the Company is not currently aware of any environmental liability with respect to its properties that would have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Additionally, the Company is not aware of any material environmental liability or any unasserted claim or assessment with respect to an environmental liability that management believes would require additional disclosure or the recording of a loss contingency.

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  'Exchange Act') that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms, and that information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer (our Chief Executive Officer) and principal financial officer (our Chief Financial Officer) as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our Chief Executive Officer (our 'CEO') and Chief Financial Officer (our 'CFO') evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

## Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related information. Management uses its best judgment to ensure that the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position and results of operations in conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Management  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over financial  reporting  as  defined  in  the  Exchange  Act.  These  internal  controls  are  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  the  reported  financial information is presented fairly, that disclosures are adequate and that the judgments inherent in the preparation of financial statements are reasonable. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls including the possibility of human error and overriding of controls. Consequently,  even  an  effective  internal  control  system  can  only  provide  reasonable,  not  absolute,  assurance  with  respect  to  reporting  financial information.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to maintaining records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with our management and directors' authorization; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention of or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Under the supervision of management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway  Commission.  Based  on  that  evaluation,  our  management  concluded  that  our  internal  controls  over  financial  reporting  were  effective  as  of December 31, 2022.

Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our internal control over financial reporting, and that firm's report on our internal control over financial reporting is set forth below.

## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Global Medical REIT Inc.

## Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Global Medical REIT Inc. and subsidiaries (the 'Company') as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated March 1, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

## Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
