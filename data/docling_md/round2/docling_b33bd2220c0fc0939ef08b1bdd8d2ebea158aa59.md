## DIRECTORS REPORT

## REVIEW OF OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES

The loss after income tax of the Group for the year ended 30 June 2022 is $2,083,972 (30 June 2021: $593,893).

Arcadia Minerals is an exploration company. The projects acquired by the Company have been developed over a period of time by the prior owners of the projects. Management and the Board have developed a three pillar strategy to provide investors and shareholders with access to the opportunities presented in the mining industry. Arcadia listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on the 22nd of November 2021.

- -Pillar One, Potential development and exploitation of a cash generating asset (Pillar One) ,
- -Pillar Two, Use of the potential cash resources from pillar one to explore and potentially transform the Company's assets (Pillar Two) and
- -Pillar Three, utilise human capital of industry specific experience tied with a history of project generation to bring projects to results (Pillar Three)

Some of the Company's projects are located in the neighbourhood of established mining operations and significant discoveries, and all the projects holds significant potential to host economic quantities of minerals that may be capable of further development and extraction.

The projects under investigation are as follows;

- 1. The Swanson Project -advanced tantalum project with early development potential
- 2. Kum-Kum Project -prospective for nickel, copper, and platinum group elements
- 3. Karibib Project -prospective for copper and gold
- 4. Bitterwasser Brines Project -prospective for lithium-in-brines
- 5. Bitterwasser Clays Project -prospective for lithium-in-clays

During the financial year, the Company commenced exploration across all projects. The projects are detailed below:

## Swanson Tantalum/ Lithium Project (Swanson)

The  advanced  Swanson  Tantalum  exploration  project  situated  in  Tantalite  Valley,  Namibia.  The  Project  is  held  through  the Comp any's 80% owned Namibian subsidiary Orange River Pegmatite (Pty) Ltd (ORP). The strategy with Swanson is to advance the project into a potentially cash generating mining operation and forms part of Pillar One.

Key highlights during the year were the rapid mobilisation of drilling contractors and two diamond drill rigs on site. Road building operations, drill pad preparation and the construction of water for drilling infrastructure was completed and drilling commenced.

The program was a follow on from the initial drilling program conducted by ORP in August 2020. The intention of the program was to explore an additional 11 (D0, D1, D2 E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E7, E8 &amp; F1) of the 15 pegmatites identified at Swanson. In addition, the drilling program specifically explored the opencast potential of the E5, E6, E7 and E8 pegmatites, and the up-dip underground potential of the F1, E4, and E5 pegmatites .  Down-dip exploration and the mineralisation of the remaining undrilled pegmatites 1 at Swanson remains to be tested.

## REVIEW OF OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES (continued)

Further, as announced on 23 September 2021 2  bench-scale metallurgical test-work were completed from a 5.45 tonne sample using  industry  standard  gravity  separation  equipment,  which  achieved  recoveries  of  76%  (spiral)  and  90%  (multi-gravityseparator). A 60-tonne bulk sample was also taken, crushed, and transported for commercial size plant test-work to simulate flowsheet,  optimise  stage  recoveries  and  to  provide  results  for  final  plant  design.  Assay  results  returned  during  the  period confirmed high grade intercepts with an average thickness of 2.31m and a weighted average grade of 559 g/t Ta2O5.

Drilling was completed for a total of 29 diamond drill holes, totalling 1,217.54 m of drilling in February 2022. All holes contained pegmatite intersections, the samples were sent to Scientific Services Laboratory in South Africa for analyses. The drillhole database was delivered to Snowden Mining Consultants to update the Mineral Resources estimate.   On 6 May 2022 a revised mineral resource delivered a new estimate including a total indicated and inferred Mineral Resource of 2.59Mt (an increase of 115%) at an average grade of 486 ppm Ta2O5 (an increase of 17.9%), 73uppm Nb2O5 and 0.15 % Li2O. The Mineral Resource is based on an exploration program that includes: 283 channel / chip samples and 52 diamond boreholes on a 50m grid spacing over 10 (of 15) outcropping open-castable shallow pegmatites located at Swanson, namely the D0, D1, D2, E2, E3, E4, E6, E7, E8 and F1. To date only 15 of the more than 200 known pegmatites present over Arcad ia's three licenses have been explored . Refer below for further information on the Swanson Tantalum Project Mineral Resource.

Subsequent to the release of the updated Mineral Resource estimate, the Minister for the Department of Mines and Energy of Namibia granted the previously applied for Mining License, ML 223 to ORP on the 3 June 2022. The license authorises ORP to commence with the necessary development work towards mining operations for Base and Rare Metals, Industrial Minerals and Precious Metals over the Swanson Tantalite Project for a period of 15 years (from 19 May 2022 up to 18 May 2037). In terms of the Minerals (Prospecting and Mining Act) of 1992, the mining license is renewable by application 12 months before its expiry date subject to ORP showing that the mineral to which the mining license relates exists in the mining area in sufficient quantity that it can be won or mined and sold. The Minister may not refuse to grant an application for the renewal of a mining licence if the holder of the license complied with the terms of the mining license and the proposed programme of mining operations and has expended the capital required for the purposes of which the mining license was granted.

Within  this  reporting  period,  ORP  also  received  notice  that  an  Environmental  Clearance  Certificate  (ECC)  to  undertake  the proposed  development  of  a  Tantalite  Mine  at  Swanson  and  to  comm ence  with  activities  specified  in  ORP's  environmental assessment report and environmental management plan filed with the Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism of Namibia was granted under reference ECC 02187.

The updated Mineral Resource estimate, granting of the Mining License and Environmental permits has established Swanson Tantalum Project in good stead for the upcoming year.

## Kum Kum Nickel and PGE Project

The Kum-Kum exploration project situated in Tantalite Valley Complex, Namibia. The Project is held through the Company's 80% owned Namibian subsidiary Orange  River  Pegmatite  (Pty)  Ltd  (ORP).  At  the  Kum-Kum  PGE  and  Nickel  project  the  Company commenced with a Minerals Systems Approach (MSA) to identify the mineral processes evident over the project and to formulate an exploration model to assist with future exploration over areas where anomalous results were attained by previous explorers during the 1970's and 1980's. The MSA will, together with hyperspectral domaining, assist the refining of a litho-geochemical sampling  program  and  a  field  mapping  campaign  over  the  Tantalite  Valley  Complex  with  the  purpose  of  understanding  the geological prospectively of the Tantalite Valley Complex before expensive intrusive exploration programs are undertaken.

The Mineral Systems Approach commenced in August 2021 by a team comprising members from Arcadia Minerals and from the Department of Earth Sciences at the Stellenbosch University, South Africa, the study was completed in 2022 and results were announced on 9 May 2022.

## ARCADIA MINERALS LIMITED

## DIRECTORS REPORT

## REVIEW OF OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES (continued)

The  Tantalite  Valley  Complex  (TVC)  geological  study  involved  various  field  sampling  campaigns  (94  field  samples  collected) augmented with detailed consideration of historical drill core segments (57 samples), and supporting data from historical records, hyperspectral  mapping,  and  stream  sediment  sampling.  The  field  samples  collected  with  the  historical  core  samples  were subjected to a suite of analytical protocols including reflected and transmitted-light optical petrography, whole-rock major and trace  element  chemistry,  precious  metal  assays,  sulphur  isotope  analyses,  scanning  electron  microscopy  with  associated spectrometry and in-situ Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) of individual sulphide grains. Together, the results provided novel insights into the known mineralisation and prospectively of the TVC.

The  TVC  hosts  two  main  categories  of  sulphides,  viz  primary  magmatic  sulphides,  hosted  by  an  orthopyroxenite,  as  well  as secondary  (or  hydrothermal)  sulphides  inside  amphibolitised  host  rocks  and  typically  found  near  shear  zones  (including  the intrusion's sheared contacts). The latter remobilized category only hosts sub -economic Cu (&lt;0.29 wt.%) and minor Ni (&lt;0.17 wt.%), while Pd+Pt values never exceed 0.15 ppm. Texturally, this assemblage comprises of predominantly pyrite, with later paragenetic rims of chalcopyrite + magnetite and ilmenite. In contrast, the primary magmatic sulphides comprise of pyrrhotite + pentlandite + chalcopyrite, with the best assay results measured for a 10-15 cm long split core, with 0.28% Cu, 0.71% Ni and 1.24 ppm Pd+Pt.

Importantly, the above stated assay values and corroborating Scanning Electron Microscope analyses constitute the first records of PGE and Au (max. Au assay value = 0.26 ppm) in the TVC. Using metal prices at the time of the study, their presence adds significantly (~24 %) to the in-ground value of the mineral assemblage. Sulphur isotopes indicate that the magmatic sulphides carry a mantle signal and no contamination by crustal sulphur. Further, various in situ and whole rock geochemical proxies enable the calculation of an R factor, which represents the degree to which an immiscible sulphide melt interacted with a silicate magma chamber to obtain its precious metal signatures. The R factor for the TVC is estimated to be between 800 and 3000, which plots towards the high end for Ni-Cu deposits, but towards the low end for world-class PGE deposits.

Following  an  established  relationship  between  Ni  and  total  PGE,  as  well  as  these  being  hosted  within  a  relatively  unique orthopyroxenitic  orthocumulate,  this  most  mineralized  target  layer  within  the  ultramafic  units  of  the  south-eastern  TVC  is suspected to have been intersected by historical boreholes TV03, N01, and PW01. These intersection depths range between 150 and 250 m below surface and likely coincide with at a pyroxenite-troctolite contact. Further targeting of this most interesting horizon should endeavour to discern the dip, strike and true thickness of the mineralized layer, whether it outcrops at surface, the degree to which it has been affected by post-magmatic processes (e.g., amphibolitisation), and its lateral and vertical (i.e., within unit) grade variability.

Superficial insights that have implications for the metallurgical properties of the mineralisation are detailed as the results of a preliminary scanning electron microscopy study of the precious metal minerals.

## Karibib Project -Cu and Au

The Karibib exploration project is situated near the mining town of Karibib, Namibia. The Project is held through the Company's 80% owned subsidiary (see-through 68%) Karibib Pegmatite Exploration (Pty) Ltd (Karibib).

At the Karibib Copper-Gold Project field work confirmed mineralisation trends over the license extends over the exposed rocks of a 20 km x 2 km metasedimentary structural feature.  Outcropping skarn-type mineralisation pointed to significant mineralisation displaying, on average, grades of 4.32 % Cu (highest 28.40% Cu), 1.49 g/t Au (highest 7.65 g/t Au), 50.50 g/t Ag (highest 453 g/t Ag) and 0.23 % (highest 1.00% WO3). Outcropping vein-type mineralisation rock chip samples returned the following results: 1.94% Cu (highest 5.69% Cu), 2.06 g/t Au (highest 26.30 g/t Au) and 12.68 g/t Ag (highest 30.10 g/t Ag) . 3

## Bitterwasser Project -Prospective for Lithium in Clays

During the year, a 64 drill hole exploration program utilising hand auger drilling mechanisms was conducted.

Final assay results for the 64 drill hole campaign over the Eden Pan were announced in May 2022. The entire sequence of the drill holes sampled (Upper Brown Clay Unit and Middle Green Glay Unit) returned lithium mineralisation . The Middle Green Clay Unit, 4 lithologically named the Middle-Unit (MU), comprised the dominant lithological unit from which the maiden Mineral Resource as announced on 3 November 2021 was derived. Subsequently an updated Mineral Resource was released, refer to the Events Occurring after Reporting Date.

This green clay unit was intersected in a total of 43 drill holes from which assay results were received and extended from a depth of 1.4 m below surface to the maximum End-of-Hole (EOH) depth of 9.60m.

Figure1: Stacked cross section of the Eden Pan depicting drill-hole interpretation with reference to the existing Mineral Resource (green layers) and clay units intercepted in the follow-up auger drilling program.

As expected, the best individual drillhole intersections for the high-grade Middle Green Clay Unit were located in the centre of the pan. These results were:

- · BMC33: From 4.8 to 9.4 m, 4.6 m @ 811 ppm Li
- · BMC32: From 3.8 to 6.6 m, 2.8 m @ 796 ppm Li
- · BMC28: From 4.2 to 9.4 m, 5.2 m @ 760 ppm Li
- · BMC36: From 3.4 to 5.6 m. 2.2 m @ 744 ppm Li

Through its local subsidiary, Brines Mining and Exploration Namibia (Pty) Ltd (BME), Arcadia has exercised a first option in terms of  an  acquisition  agreement  to acquire up to 100% of Bitterwasser Lithium Exploration (Pty) Ltd (BLE), which the acquisition agreement was approved by shareholders on 5 April 2022.  By exercising the first option, Arcadia has acquired 25% of BLE in return for a consideration of approximately A$92,000. Arcadia holds an additional option for 2 years from 12 April 2022 to acquire the remaining 75% of BLE (and thereby own 100% of the Bitterwasser Pan district) in consideration of approximately A$184,000.

Combined with the 3,438Km2 owned by BME and the BLE licenses, the land holding currently under investigation by Arcadia comprises 4,031Km2 in extent.

## ARCADIA MINERALS LIMITED

## REVIEW OF OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES (continued)

## Bitterwasser Project -Prospective for Lithium in Brines

Exploration over the Lithium in Brines project, is to be conducted in five phases, of which the first and second were completed during the year ended 30 June 2022:

## Phase 1 (Completed)

Acquisition and consolidation of all historical geology, geohydrology, geochemical and geophysical data available for the project area and its surroundings.

## Phase 2 (Completed)

Construction of a comprehensive geological and geohydrological model of the regional and local Bitterwasser System controlling known lithium-in-clay mineralisation and lithium-in-brine mineralisation.

## Phase 3 (In Progress)

Stratigraphic drilling to be able to build a geological section of the basin and understand the basin parameters, water sampling (hot springs and g roundwater), and airborne geophysical surveys aimed at understanding the Project's stratigraphy and identifying potential trap sites for additional lithium-in-clay mineralisation, and to prove lithium-in-brines mineralisation at depth.

## Phase 4 (Planned)

Targeted drilling of potential trap sites to determine volume and grade of brines and additional sub-terranean clay horizons.

## Phase 5 (Planning stages)

Targeting and drilling of geothermal structures for potential energy harvesting, which could have significant ESG impact

If the phased work program is successfully implemented, the intention is to drill the high priority exploration drill targets in an effort to make a discovery of lithium-in-brine mineralisation at depth and to conduct exploration work to discover sub-surface lithium-in-clay mineralisation similar to what is currently expressed on surface.

There were no further substantive exploration activities at the projects by the Company during the reporting period.

## ANNUAL MINERAL RESOURCES REPORT AS AT 30 JUNE 2022

In accordance with ASX listing rule 5.21, Arcadia Minerals reports its Mineral Resources on an annual basis. The date of reporting is 30 June each year to coincide with company financial year end. If there are any material changes to the Company's Mineral Resource the Company is required to publish these changes promptly.

There was no Mineral Resource reported at 30 June 2020, the Company released two Mineral Resource statements being the Swanson Tantalum Project and the Bitterwasser Prospective for Lithium in Clays details as follows:

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022

## NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

## (a) Reporting Entity

Arcadia Minerals Limited (referred to as the 'Company' or 'parent entity' ) is a company domiciled in Guernsey and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). The address of the Compa ny's registered office and principal place of business is disclosed in the Corporate Directory of the Report. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as  at  and  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2022  comprise  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  (together, the  'Group' or 'consolidated entity' ).

## (b) Basis of Preparation

## i. Statement of compliance

These general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee, applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008, and the Listing Requirements of the Australian Securities Exchange.

## ii. Basis of measurement

## Historical Cost Convention

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical costs convention, expect for where applicable, the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, investment properties, certain classes of property, plant and equipment and derivative financial instruments.

## iii. Parent entity information

These financial statements present the results of the consolidated entity only. Supplementary information about the parent entity is disclosed in Note 22.

## iv. New or amended International Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations adopted

The  consolidated  entity  has  adopted  all  of  the  new  or  amended  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  and Interpretations that are mandatory for the current reporting period. The adoption of these did not have a material impact on the consolidated entity.

Any new or amended International Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been early adopted.

## v. New International Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted

International Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet mandatory, have not been early adopted by the consolidated entity for the annual reporting period ended 30 June 2022.  The  consolidated  entity  has  not  yet  assessed  the  impact  of  these  new  or  amended  International  Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations.

## vi. Significant Judgements and Estimates

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  requires  the  use  of  certain  critical  accounting  estimates.  It  also  requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the consolidated entity 's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 2.

## ARCADIA MINERALS LIMITED

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022

## (c) Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all entities controlled by Arcadia Minerals Limited at the end of the reporting year. A controlled entity is any entity over which Arcadia Minerals Limited has the power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from the entity's activities. Control will generally exist where the parent owns, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, more than half of the voting power of an entity. In assessing the power to govern, the existence and effect of holdings of actual and potential voting rights are also considered.

Where controlled entities have entered or left the consolidated entity during the year, the financial performance of those entities are included only for the period of the year that they were controlled.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all inter-group balances and transactions between entities in the consolidated entity have been eliminated on consolidation.  Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with those adopted by the parent entity.

Non-controlling interests, being the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent, are shown separately within the Equity section of the statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.  The non-controlling interests in the net assets comprise their interests at the date of the original business combination and their share of changes in equity since that date.

## (d) Foreign Currency Translation

The  financial  statements  are  presented  in  Australian  dollars,  which  is Arcadia  Minerals  Limited's functional  and presentation currency.

## Foreign currency transactions

Foreign currency transactions are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.  Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the transaction at the financial year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.

## Foreign operations

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the reporting  date.    The  revenues  and  expenses  of  foreign  operations  are  translated  into  Australian  dollars  using  the average exchange rates, which approximate the rates of the transactions, for the period.  All resulting foreign exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income through the foreign currency reserve in equity.

The foreign currency reserve is recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation or net investment is disposed of.

## (e) Other Income

## i. Interest

Interest revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method. This is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and allocating the interest income over the relevant period using the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial interest to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.

## ii. Other revenue

Other revenue is recognised when it is received or when the right to receive payment is established.

## ARCADIA MINERALS LIMITED

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022

## (f) Income Tax

The income tax expense (revenue) for the period comprises current income tax expense (income) and deferred tax expense (income).

Current income tax expense charged to the profit or loss is the tax payable on taxable income calculated using applicable income tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted, as at the end of the reporting period.  Current tax liabilities (assets) are therefore measured at the amounts expected to be paid to (recovered from) the relevant taxation authority.

Deferred income tax expense reflects movements in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances during the period as well as unused tax losses.

Current and deferred income tax expense (income) is charged or credited directly to equity instead of the profit or loss when the tax relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are ascertained based on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  in  the  financial  statements.  Deferred  tax  assets  also  result  where amounts have been fully expensed but future tax deductions are available.  No deferred income tax will be recognised from  the  initial  recognition  of  an  asset  or  liability,  excluding  a  business  combination,  where  there  is  no  effect  on accounting or taxable profit or loss.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.  Their measurement also reflects the manner in which management expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of the related asset or liability.

Deferred tax assets relating to temporary differences and unused tax losses are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the benefits of the deferred tax asset can be utilised.

Where temporary differences exist in relation to investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates, and joint ventures, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is not probable that the reversal will occur in the foreseeable future.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists and it is intended that net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists, the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where it is intended that net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur in future periods in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled.

## (g) Exploration and evaluation expenditure

Acquisition costs of exploration and evaluation of separate areas of interest for which rights of tenure are current are carried forward as an asset in the statement of financial position where it is expected that the expenditure will be recovered through the successful development and exploitation of an area of interest, or by its sale; or exploration activities are continuing in an area and activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable estimate of the existence  or  otherwise  of  economically  recoverable  reserves.  Where  a  project  or  an  area  of  interest  has  been abandoned, the expenditure incurred thereon is written off in the year in which the decision is made.

Exploration and evaluation expenditure on each separate areas of interest, subsequent to its acquisition, are expensed to profit of loss.

## ARCADIA MINERALS LIMITED

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022

## (h) Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash on hand and in bank and short-term deposits are stated at nominal value. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash includes cash on hand and in bank, and bank securities readily convertible to cash, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.

## (i) Trade and Other Receivables

Trade and other receivables include amounts due from customers for goods sold and services performed in the ordinary course of business. Receivables expected to be collected within 12 months of the end of the reporting  period are classified as current assets. All other receivables are classified as non-current assets. The consolidated entity has applied the simplified approach to measuring the expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance. To measure  expected  credit  losses,  trade  receivables  have  been  grouped  on  days  overdue.  Other  receivables  are recognised at amortised cost, less any allowance for expected credit losses.

## (j) Impairment of Assets

Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset, other than goodwill, is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent the  increased  carrying  amount  does  not  exceed  the  carrying  amount  that  would  have  been  determined  had  no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

## (k) Trade and Other Payables

Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods and services received whether or not billed to the consolidated entity.  Trade payables are usually settled within 30 days of recognition.

## (l) Employee Benefits

## i. Short-term employee benefits

Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and long service leave expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised in current liabilities in respect of employees' services up to the reporting date and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.

## ii. Other long-term employee benefits

The liability for annual leave and long service leave not expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised in non-current liabilities, provided there is an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability. The liability is measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to the expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on national government bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022

## (m) Share-based Payments

Equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation benefits are provided to Key Management Personnel and employees. Equity-settled transactions are awards of shares, or options over shares, that are provided to employees in exchange for the rendering of services. Cash-settled transactions are awards of cash for the exchange of services, where the amount of cash is determined by reference to the share price.

The cost of equity-settled transactions are measured at fair value on grant date. Fair value is independently determined using an appropriate valuation model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option, together with non-vesting conditions that do not determine whether the consolidated entity receives the services that entitle the employees to receive payment. No account is taken of any other vesting conditions.

The cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period. The cumulative charge to profit or loss is calculated based on the grant date fair value of the award, the best estimate of the number of awards that are likely to vest and the expired portion of the vesting period. The amount recognised in profit or loss for the period is the cumulative amount calculated at each reporting date less amounts already recognised in previous periods.

The cost of cash-settled transactions is initially, and at each reporting date until vested, determined by applying an appropriate valuation model, taking into consideration the terms and conditions on which the award was granted. The cumulative charge to profit or loss until settlement of the liability is calculated as follows:

- · During  the  vesting  period,  the  liability  at  each  reporting  date  is  the  fair  value  of  the  award  at  that  date multiplied by the expired portion of the vesting period.
- · From the end of the vesting period until settlement of the award, the liability is the full fair value of the liability at the reporting date.

All changes in the liability are recognised in profit or loss. The ultimate cost of cash-settled transactions is the cash paid to settle the liability.

Market conditions are taken into consideration in determining fair value. Therefore, any awards subject to market conditions are considered to vest irrespective of whether or not that market condition has been met, provided all other conditions are satisfied.

If equity-settled awards are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the modification has not been made. An additional expense is recognised, over the remaining vesting period, for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based compensation benefit as at the date of modification.

If  the  non-vesting  condition  is  within  the  control  of  the  consolidated  entity  or  employee,  the  failure  to  satisfy  the condition is treated as a cancellation. If the condition is not within the control of the consolidated entity or employee and is not satisfied during the vesting period, any remaining expense for the award is recognised over the remaining vesting period, unless the award is forfeited.

If equity-settled awards are cancelled, it is treated as if it has vested on the date of cancellation, and any remaining expense is recognised immediately. If a new replacement award is substituted for the cancelled award, the cancelled and new award is treated as if they were a modification.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022

## (n) Issued Capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

## (o) Segment reporting

A business segment is identified for a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different to those of other business segments. A geographical segment is identified when products or services are provided within a particular economic environment subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.

## (p) Financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated entity 's statement of financial position when the consolidated entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

At each reporting date, the financial assets are assessed for impairment.

## (q) Earnings Per Share

## i.

Basic earnings per share

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing:

- · the profit attributable to owners of the Company, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares
- · by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the year and excluding treasury shares.

## ii. Diluted earnings per share

Diluted earnings per share adjust the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account:

- · the after-income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares, and
- · the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

## ARCADIA MINERALS LIMITED

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022

## (r) Current and Non-Current classification

Assets  and  liabilities  are  presented  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  based  on  current  and  non-current classification.

An asset is classified as current when: it is either expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the consolidated entity's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is expected to be realised within  12  months  after  the  reporting  period;  or  the  asset  is  cash  or  cash  equivalent  unless  restricted  from  being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is classified as current when: it is either expected to be settled in the consolidated entity's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period; or there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other liabilities are classified as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current.

## (s) Dividends

Dividends are recognised when declared during the financial year and no longer at the discretion of the Company.

## (t) Associates

Associates are entities over which the consolidated entity has significant influence but not control or  joint control. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the share of the profits or losses of the associate is recognised in profit or loss and the share of the movements in equity is recognised in other comprehensive income. Investments in associates are carried in the statement of financial position at cost plus postacquisition changes in the consolidated entity's share of net assets of the associate. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment. Dividends received or receivable from associates reduce the carrying amount of the investment.

When the consolidated entity's share of losses in an associate equal or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any unsecured long-term receivables, the consolidated entity does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

The  consolidated  entity  discontinues  the  use  of  the  equity  method  upon  the  loss  of  significant  influence  over  the associate and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the associate's carrying amount, fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.

## NOTE 2: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Management continually evaluates its judgements and estimates  in  relation  to  assets,  liabilities,  contingent  liabilities,  revenue  and  expenses.  Management  bases  its judgements, estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on other various factors, including expectations of future events management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting judgements and estimates will seldom equal the related actual results. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.

## Share based payments

The consolidated entity measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by using an appropriate valuation  model  taking  into  account  the  terms  and  conditions  upon  which  the  instruments  were  granted.  The accounting estimates and assumptions relating to equity-settled share-based payments would have no impact on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next annual reporting period  but may impact profit or loss and equity.

## NOTE 17: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES

The Group's activities expose it t o a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of the financia l markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. The Group uses different methods to measure and manage different types of risks to which it is exposed. These include monitoring levels of exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk and assessments of market forecasts for interest rate and foreign exchange prices. Ageing analysis and monitoring of specific credit allowances are undertaken to manage credit risk. Liquidity risk is monitored through the development of future cash flow forecasts.

Risk management is carried out by Management and overseen by the Board of Directors with assistance from suitably qualified external advisors. The main risks arising for the Group are foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.

The carrying values of the Group's financial instruments are as follows:

Financial Assets

| Trade and other receivables   | 75,791    | 40,398    |
|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Cash and cash equivalents     | 2,840,406 | 6,165,049 |
|                               | 2,916,197 | 6,205,447 |
| Financial Liabilities         |           |           |
| Trade and other payables      | (107,422) | (633,780) |

## (a) Market risk

- i. Foreign exchange risk

The currency risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to change in foreign exchange rates. Currency risk arises when future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the Group's functional currency. The Group is expos ed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures primarily with respect to the Australian Dollar (AUD), the Group's functional currency. The Group's policy is not to enter into an y currency hedging transactions.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022

## NOTE 17: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued)

## ii. Interest rate risk

The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, which is the risk that a financial instrument's value will fluctuate as a result of changes in the market interest rates on interest bearing financial instruments. The G roup's exposure to this risk relates primarily to the Group's cash and any cash on deposit.  The Group does not use derivatives to mitigate these exposures. The Group manages its exposure to interest rate risk by holding certain amounts of cash in fixed and floating interest rate facilities.  At the reporting date, the interest rate profile of the Group's interest -bearing financial instruments was:

|                           | Weighted average   |            |
|---------------------------|--------------------|------------|
|                           | interest rate *    | Balance    |
| Cash and cash equivalents | 0.31%              | $2,840,406 |

Movements in the changes to interest rates will not have material effect on the profit or loss of the Group.

## (b) Credit risk

Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and other financial assets. The Group's exposure to credit risk arises from potential default of the counterparty, with maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the financial assets.

The Group's policy is to trade only with recognise d, creditworthy third parties. It is the Group's policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms will be subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group 's exposure to bad debts is not significant. There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.

## (c) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.  The Gr oup's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to its reputation.

The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves from funds raised in the market and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows.  The Group does not have any external borrowings.

The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities:

## (d) Capital risk management

The G roup's objectives when manag ing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

Capital is regarded as total equity, as recognised in the statement of financial position, plus net debt. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.

## ARCADIA MINERALS LIMITED

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022

## NOTE 17: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued)

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the number of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

Given the stage of the Company's development there are no formal targets set for return on capital. There were no changes to the Company's approach to capital management during the year. The Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. The net equity of the Company is equivalent to capital. Net capital is obtained through capital raisings on the Aus tralian Securities Exchange ('ASX').

## Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

## Other Information

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Group's annual report for the year ended 30 June 2022, but does not include the financial report and the auditor's report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

- If,  based  on  the  work  we  have  performed,  we  conclude  that  there  is  a  material  misstatement  of  this  other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with  the  International  Standards  on  Auditing  will  always  detect  a  material  misstatement  when  it  exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.

As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- · Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- · Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.
- · Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.
- · Conclude on the appropriateness of the director's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- · Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- · Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities  within  the  Group  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  financial  report.  We  are  responsible  for  the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

Perth, WA Dated: 28 September 2022

TUTU PHONG Director

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other  matters  that  may  reasonably  be  thought  to  bear  on  our  independence,  and  where  applicable,  related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial report of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## ARCADIA MINERALS LIMITED

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT

## Introduction

Arcadia Minerals Limited (Company) has established a corporate governance framework, the key features of which are set out in this  statement.  In  establishing  its  corporate  governance  framework,  the  Company  refers  to  the  recommended  corporate governance practices for ASX listed entities set out in the ASX Corporate Governance Council Principles and Recommendations

## (Principles and Recommendations).

This Corporate Governance Statement discloses the extent to which the Company followed the recommendations set out in the Principles  and  Recommendations (Recommendations) for  the  Reporting  Period.    The  Recommendations  are  not  mandatory, however, the Recommendations not followed have been identified and reasons have been provided for not following them along with what (if any) alternative governance practices the Company adopted in lieu of the recommendation.

The  Company  has  adopted  a  Corporate  Gover nance  Plan  which  provides  the  written  terms  of  reference  for  the  Company's corporate governance duties.

Under the Company's Board Charter, the duties that would ordinarily be assigned to individual committees are currently carried out by the full Board under the written terms of reference for those committees.

The information in the statement is current at 28 September 2022 and was approved by a resolution of the Board on the 28 September 2022.

## Corporate governance policies and procedures
