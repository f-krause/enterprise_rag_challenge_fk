       "'## SYSTEM PROMPT\\n\\nYou are a chatbot designed to answer questions about company annual reports. The information may appear in markdown \\ntables or as plain text. Your responses must be strictly based on the provided context and adhere to the following guidelines:\\n\\n1. **Answer Schema:**\\n    - For Integer Numeric Answers: Provide only the numeric value without commas, spaces, or additional text. For values given in thousands or millions, write the full number (e.g., if stated in millions, the answer for 88.1 would be \"88100000\" or for 1k answer \"1000\"). \\n    - For Float Numeric Answers (e.g. ratios): answer with a decimal (e.g., 0.5).\\n    - For Name-Based Answers: Provide only the exact name as it appears in the data. No additional text, formatting, or variations (e.g. \"Max Mustermann\").\\n    - For Boolean Answers: Provide only \"yes\" or \"no\".\\n    - For Insufficient Data: If the information is not available, respond with \"na\".\\n\\n2. **Context Adherence:**  \\n   - Only use the information provided in the CONTEXT. Do not assume or add external data.\\n   - The context contains retrieved chunks of company annual reports with some similarity score to the user query. Use this information to answer the questions.\\n   - Ensure your final answer strictly follows the designated schema.\\n   \\n3. **Domain Assumptions:**\\n  - For financial values, assume totals unless otherwise specified.\\n  - Always provide \\n  - For roles like CEO or CFO, assume the question refers to the current position.\\n  - For company names, use the exact name as it appears in the data.\\n\\n4. **Table Analysis and Correction:**  \\n   - When analyzing markdown tables (or other data structures), be alert to any conversion or formatting issues. Common issues include:\\n     - Inconsistent use of thousand separators (commas, spaces, etc.).\\n     - Numbers split across multiple rows or columns.\\n     - Data misalignment or merging of columns.\\n   - Use contextual clues (such as column headers, totals, or adjacent entries) to determine if an entry might be affected by a table parsing error.\\n   - **Only output a corrected numerical value if you are sufficiently confident that a formatting flaw has occurred and you can deduce the correct value.**  \\n   - If you are not fully confident that the anomaly is due to a parsing error, or if the correct value remains ambiguous, output \"na\" and include a brief note (internally) that the data is ambiguous.\\n\\n5. **General Answer Guidelines:**  \\n   - Include a short explanation of your reasoning in the chain of thought.\\n   - Your final answer should be in one of the prescribed formats (number, boolean, concise string, or \"na\"). \\n   - If the question asks for a correction due to a suspected table parsing error, provide the corrected number only if the evidence is compelling; otherwise, output \"na\". Provide your thoughts in the chain of thought\\n\\n6. **Example Response Structure:**\\n   - *If confident:*  \\n     **Final Answer:** `5839`  \\n     (Explanation: The table appeared to split the building cost for Oklahoma City - 12/20/21 over two rows; based on the CONTEXT, the correct value is deduced as 5839.)\\n\\n   - *If uncertain:*  \\n     **Final Answer:** `na`  \\n     (Explanation: Insufficient clarity in the table data due to formatting issues.)\\n\\n\\n## CONTEXT:\\nchunk id: 150, score: 0.5561889, content: {\\'title\\': \\'RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022, COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021\\', \\'company\\': \\'calyxt\\', \\'level\\': 2, \\'table\\': True, \\'previous_titles\\': [\\'## Interest, net\\', \\'## Non-operating income (expenses)\\', \\'## Changes Between Revenues and Costs\\'], \\'part_index\\': 2, \\'total_parts\\': 2, \\'content\\': \\'|                                                             | Year Ended December 31,                  | Year Ended December 31,                  | Year Ended December 31,                  | Year Ended December 31,                  |\\\\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\\\\n|                                                             | 2022                                     | 2021                                     | $ Change                                 | % Change                                 |\\\\n|                                                             | (In thousands, except percentage values) | (In thousands, except percentage values) | (In thousands, except percentage values) | (In thousands, except percentage values) |\\\\n| Revenue                                                     | $ 157                                    | $ 25,987                                 | $(25,830)                                | (99)%                                    |\\\\n| Cost of goods sold                                          | -                                        | 28,557                                   | (28,557)                                 | (100)%                                   |\\\\n| Gross profit                                                | 157                                      | (2,570)                                  | 2,727                                    | 106%                                     |\\\\n| Research and development                                    | 11,553                                   | 11,335                                   | 218                                      | 2%                                       |\\\\n| Selling, general, and administrative                        | 10,974                                   | 15,427                                   | (4,453)                                  | (29)%                                    |\\\\n| Loss from operations                                        | (22,370)                                 | (29,332)                                 | 6,962                                    | 24%                                      |\\\\n| Gain upon extinguishment of Payroll Protection Program loan | -                                        | 1,528                                    | (1,528)                                  | (100)%                                   |\\\\n| Interest, net                                               | (87)                                     | (1,414)                                  | 1,327                                    | 94%                                      |\\\\n| Non-operating income (expenses)                             | 5,566                                    | 19                                       | 5,547                                    | 29,195%                                  |\\\\n| Net loss                                                    | $(16,891)                                | $(29,199)                                | $ 12,308                                 | 42%                                      |\\\\n| Basic and diluted net loss per share                        | $ (0.37)                                 | $ (0.78)                                 | $ 0.41                                   | 53%                                      |\\'}\\n\\nchunk id: 151, score: 0.515772, content: {\\'title\\': \\'Revenue, Cost of Goods Sold, and Gross Profit\\', \\'company\\': \\'calyxt\\', \\'level\\': 2, \\'table\\': False, \\'previous_titles\\': [\\'## Changes Between Revenues and Costs\\', \\'## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022, COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021\\', \\'## Table of Contents\\'], \\'part_index\\': 1, \\'total_parts\\': 1, \\'content\\': \"Revenues were $0.2 million in 2022, a decrease of $26.0 million, or 99 percent, from 2021.
